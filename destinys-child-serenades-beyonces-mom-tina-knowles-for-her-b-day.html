And I have had the time of my life with all of my beautiful friends from Texas and my friends from California,” she began in the clip.</p><p>“This has been a spiritual weekend, and just about the empowerment of kick-ass women. Just tough, beautiful women filled with love. And I feel so loved,” Knowles continued. “I had a little anxiety about turning 70, you know? But I’m so blessed to be here, and I’m so blessed to have the life that I have and the people that I have around me. All the love.”</p><p>That love featured a performance by a group she helped guide since their formation in 1990 in Texas.</p><p>“I just got spoiled to death this weekend. I even got serenaded by Destiny’s Child. How amazing is that?” she remarked.</p><p>Knowles also received comments from several celebrities wishing her happy birthday, including <strong>Debbie Allen</strong>, <strong>Tamar Braxton</strong>, <strong>La La Anthony</strong> and <strong>Octavia Spencer</strong>. <strong>Holly Robinson Peete</strong> summed up their sentiments, writing, “You are LOVED!!!!!!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Tina-Knowles-Serenaded-by-Destiny-s-Child-for-70th-Birthday-Celebration-feature-inline.jpg><p>“I just want to thank everyone who sent me flowers, everyone that told me happy birthday,” Knowles added in her video. “I got so many well-wishes.

I love you so much.”</p><p>Destiny’s Child also recently reunited to sing for the birthday of <strong>Kelly Rowland’</strong>s husband, <strong>Tim Weatherspoon.</strong></p><p>When Weatherspoon<a href=#> turned 50 last week</a> at the Fleur Room in Los Angeles, Rowland, and Beyoncé, both 42, and <strong>Michelle Williams</strong> sang a special rendition of “Happy Birthday” before his and Kelly’s sons — Titan, 8, and Noah, 2 — joined in to help their father blow out the candles on his cake.</p><p>Destiny’s Child also reunited when Beyoncé took her Renaissance World Tour to her hometown of Houston in September 2023. On January 3, former group member <strong>LeToya Luckett</strong> <a href=#>shared a sweet photo</a> of the girl group’s reunion.</p><p>In the shot taken backstage, Luckett, Beyoncé, Rowland, Williams and <strong>LaTavia Roberson</strong> stood in a row.</p><p>“✨ALL LOVE✨,” Luckett, 42, <a href=# rel=noopener>captioned the post</a>. “This was hands down my favorite moment of 2023 ❤️.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She wrote that the love, joy, prayer and healing that she experienced during their reunion is what made it feel so special.</p><p>“May we all experience beautiful moments like this in 2024,” Luckett added.</p><p>The only former member missing from the group snap was <strong>Farrah Franklin</strong>, who joined Destiny’s Child in 2000 along with Williams, 44, to replace Luckett and Roberson, 42.
