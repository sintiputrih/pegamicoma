In addition to tracking things like stress, heart rate variability, and skin temperature, it’s also able to track calorie burn and optimize your workouts. There’s also no need to lug a phone around with you on any of your workouts or outdoor adventures, as the Fitbit Charge 5 has built-in GPS that allows you to see your real-time pace and distance, and to see a map of your workout routine in the Fitbit app. This fitness tracker can reach up to seven days of battery life on a single charge, even for workout warriors who plan on putting it to good use. Closing out the top features of the Fitbit Charge 5 is a Health Metrics dashboard that provides all of your fitness data for you in one place.</p><h2>Fitbit Sense 2 — $230, was $300</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The <a href=#>Fitbit Sense 2</a> is the smartwatch designed to help you stress less, sleep better, and liver healthier. It has all-day stress detection functionality that can recognize stressful events and help you manage them and move on stress-free. Sleep profiles and sleep reports teach you about the quality of your previous night’s sleep. Heart rate tracking and fitness tracking are part of the package, and the Fitbit Sense 2 even has built-in GPS. You’re able to sync the Fitbit Sense 2 with your phone and receive notifications for calls, texts, calendar events and apps right on your wrist. This is a great smartwatch for just about anyone who takes their health seriously. It is also a good consideration if you’re interested in the <a href=#>Apple Watch SE 2</a> or even the <a href=#>Apple Watch Series 7</a> but would like a slightly lower price point.</p><h4 class="b-editors-recs-title h-editors-recs-title">Editors' Recommendations</h4><span id=publisher-md itemprop=publisher itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/Organization><span itemprop=url itemtype=https://schema.org/Url content="https://www.digitaltrends.com"><span itemprop=logo itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXGoquapKSnsq%2Bw0meaqKVforyjtcueZp%2BhpJe2tXnCoZirn5Vigm6yyK2ZoqxdqLKvv8RmaWaclZa5bq7ErKtmmqWueq6t2GZpaWpjZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-is-big-bang-theory-pennys-last-name.html><span>←</span><span>Big Bang Theory Producers Didn't Give Penny A Last Name For A Superstitious Reason</span></a>
