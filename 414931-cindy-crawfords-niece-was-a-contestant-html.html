But while her TV appearance was entertaining, Skov's life offscreen has been just as interesting.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Cindy Crawford's Niece Is a College Graduate</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Skov attended the University of Washington, where she majored in Linguistics. During her time there, she was a part of the school's women's rowing team and competed throughout her tuition and even after.</p><p class=dh>In May 2021, her team beat California at the Windermere Cup Regatta. Skov posted a photo from the momentous event of her <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/COWa6B0F4mO/><u>team members celebrating</u></a> and holding their cups up triumphantly.

She <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://gohuskies.com/sports/womens-rowing/roster/lark-skov/12025>graduated from USW</a> in 2020 and has shared little glimpses of her life <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/sharkthelark/><u>on social media</u></a>.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Lark Skov on Her Experience in 'Claim to Fame'</strong></h2></p><p class=dh><a class="me a" href=#><u>Keke Palmer</u></a>'s sister, Loreal "LC" Palmer, won season one of "Claim to Fame."

In one episode, Skov did a lie-detector challenge where she was asked if her celebrity relative was friends with <a class="me a" href=#><u>Snoop Dogg</u></a>.</p><p class=dh>Although she was unsure, she replied no, and Crawford later texted her pictures with the rapper.
