This can lead to top people on the site feeling judged. Diana Deets died by suicide earlier this month and fans are now just learning about her family’s tragedy.</p><p data-characters=564 data-current-count=938 data-injectable=true>Deets, who went by “Coconut Kitty” online, killed herself around Feb. 12. News was broken to followers on her social media accounts on Saturday and in the statement, her family describes her as a “light to this world,” “always glowing,” and “so kind.” Fans and fellow models are heartbroken, and, while the mother (thought to have been 24)’s surviving relatives did not give a reason, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">unconfirmed reports</a> are saying she suffered from depression caused by backlash related to what she would publish on the site.</p><p data-characters=896 data-current-count=896 data-injectable=true>For those who are unaware of or do not have the ability to click around and look at items made by Deets, she would regularly post semi-nude and suggestive photos on Twitter while putting other content behind a paywall and was accused of editing her photos to make herself look younger in an attempt to attract pedophiles. Deets dismissed this in a 2021 story filed <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">by Rolling Stone</a> and says she was more inspired by anime characters and this distortion allowed her to protect her identity to a degree. This did not work for anti-porn advocates like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kate Oseen</a>, who has accused Deets of grooming underage women, but, Deets said during her life she would never do something unsafe for herself or other people. Now, she is at peace. Although her family has a deep wound and the problem with people on the site <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">dying</a> due to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">pressures</a> and depression is a trend which is not decreasing at the moment.</p><p data-characters=401 data-current-count=401 data-injectable=false>If you or someone you know may be considering suicide, please contact the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">National Suicide Prevention Lifeline</a>&nbsp;at 1-800-273-8255 (En Español: 1-888-628-9454; Deaf and Hard of Hearing: 1-800-799-4889) or the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Crisis Text Line</a>&nbsp;by texting HOME to 741741.
