On a recent episode of Frankel’s podcast <strong>ReWives</strong>, the two former friends hashed out their grievances against one another and even put some of them to rest.</p><p data-characters=291 data-current-count=537 data-injectable=true>The podcast chat between Frankel and Zarin was the very first time in 13 years that the two women were alone together in the same space. Frankel credits her fiancé, Paul Bernon,&nbsp;with the reunion, saying he suggested that the two women&nbsp;<a href=#>watch the&nbsp;RHONY&nbsp;reboot</a>&nbsp;together and chat about it.</p><p data-characters=240 data-current-count=240 data-injectable=false>Initially hesitant to agree to the podcast reunion, Zarin said her daughter convinced her to do it. She explained, “Maybe be cause I’m medicated now, and I wasn’t 13 years ago – in a good way. <a href=#>I have anxiety</a>.”</p><p data-characters=187 data-current-count=427 data-injectable=true>Referencing her meme-worthy saying that she uttered on one particularly fraught RHONY episode, the 52-year-old Frankel stated on her podcast, “We’re mentioning it all.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-long-overdue-conversation data-injectable=false>The long-overdue conversation</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=368 data-current-count=668 data-injectable=true>In the first few years of RHONY being filmed, Frankel and Zarin, 59, were tighter than a new jar of skin cream. But in season three, they argued bitterly after Frankel claimed that Zarin was behaving jealously over her success. Frankel’s success included growing her food & drink lifestyle brand Skinnygirl and landing her spin-off show, Bethenny Ever After.</p><p data-characters=169 data-current-count=169 data-injectable=false>Zarin fought back by stating that Frankel was not supportive when her husband, Bobby Zarin, struggled to fight cancer. He later lost his battle and died in January 2018.</p><p data-characters=413 data-current-count=582 data-injectable=true>Zarin addressed the jealousy accusations by insisting that she was not jealous of Frankel’s success, but she did want to feel included in that success. She told Frankel on the podcast, “[I did not] resent your success; what I resented was that you didn’t want to share anything with me. I was happy for you,” Zarin went on. “[I had] FOMO for sure. I could write a book about FOMO.”</p><p data-characters=162 data-current-count=162 data-injectable=false>Frankel took her to task on that statement and stated that Frankel talked to Bravo executives about her spin-off show “in a way that was problematic.”</p><p data-characters=310 data-current-count=472 data-injectable=true>Zarin countered by bringing up a Today Show appearance on which Frankel said that she became a massive success on Real Housewives of New York after a producer discovered her. At the same time, Zarin asserted that she was the one that brought Frankel on the show by arranging for her to meet network executives.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Accusations surround a heartbreaking death</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by ReWives (@rewiveswithbethennypod)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=286 data-current-count=586 data-injectable=true>Another point of contention was whether Zarin knew about Bravo cameras being present at her husband’s funeral to record Frankel showing up to pay her respects. Zarin revealed that she felt taken advantage of and only found out that Bravo cameras were there when the episode aired.</p><p data-characters=63 data-current-count=63 data-injectable=false>Frankel insisted that she thought Zarin knew about the cameras:</p><p data-characters=151 data-current-count=214 data-injectable=false>“What you’re saying is I [blanking] ambushed a funeral for reality television,” Bethenny said. “That’s disgusting.”</p><p data-characters=536 data-current-count=750 data-injectable=true>Being on a reality series together made their friendship more complicated. This was evident when Zarin stated that it wasn’t true that Bravo executive Andy Cohen told her to fix her friendship with Frankel. “I don’t remember him ever saying to me until it was too late,” Zarin claimed, “Anyway, the point is that I definitely made mistakes. And I wanted to be there for you when you got pregnant and all that stuff, and you just wouldn’t let me in. Why didn’t you want to let me back in?”</p><p data-characters=445 data-current-count=445 data-injectable=true>Frankel responded that she worried that any genuine act of friendship between the two had become tainted by the show and was forced into becoming a storyline. Frankel complained, “Every time I did something, it became public. I sent a freaking gift basket for Bobby, it became public. Everything that happened, you then would later leak if you didn’t get the result you wanted, like, if the next week we weren’t friends.”</p><p data-characters=161 data-current-count=161 data-injectable=false>While the two former co-stars did not agree on every point of their conflict, they did appear to put the painful emotions about their failed friendship to rest.</p><p data-characters=279 data-current-count=440 data-injectable=false>Frankel is busy with her business and podcast, and Zarin has been asked about joining the Housewives reboot. She declined and recently said, “The&nbsp;Housewives&nbsp;for me has come and passed. I loved it when I did it. I’m aged out, and now there’s a new crop.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yztM6nsGarpJa%2FtHnBnquhnZ6jxm6y0ZqlpJ2cYq6vsIyjoKWkXa%2Bus7XNrGSfnaWZeqK6w2apnq2enryvecSxp6WZmaOypXs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-to-start-frozen-wilds.html><span>←</span><span>How to start frozen wilds</span></a>
