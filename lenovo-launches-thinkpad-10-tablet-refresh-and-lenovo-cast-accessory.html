It keeps a lot of what made the ThinkPad 10 a decent tablet, including the 10.1‚Äù 1920x1200 16:10 display. It continues to offer 2 or 4 GB of LPDDR3 memory, as well as both 64 and 128 GB eMMC storage options. The big change is to the processor, with the ThinkPad 10 now being powered by the 14 nm Intel Cherry Trail Atom, specifically the x5-Z8500 or x7-Z8700 models. It is also rated at the same ten hours of battery life with the integrated 32&nbsp;Wh battery, and includes the ThinkPad Pen Pro technology with WRITEit. WRITEit is a Lenovo software add-on which allows the pen to be used for almost any input.</p><p>Since this tablet is aimed at the enterprise, it also includes features that you will be hard pressed to find in consumer level tablets including optional dTPM encryption, a fingerprint reader, or a smart card reader. Lenovo will even do laser etching and asset tagging of this model to assist companies with inventory control.</p><p>As an enterprise tablet, it also has a full assortment of accessories including a folio keyboard, ultrabook keyboard, QuickShot cover, tablet dock, protector case, and more.</p><table align=center border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=1 width=575><tbody readability=11><tr class=tgrey readability=2><td align=center colspan=7>Lenovo ThinkPad Tablet 10</td></tr><tr class=tlblue readability=4><td width=120>&nbsp;</td><td align=center valign=middle width=120>Lenovo ThinkPad 10 Gen 2 (2015)</td><td align=center valign=middle width=120>Lenovo ThinkPad 10 Gen 1 (2014)</td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=tlgrey>Dimensions</td><td align=center valign=middle>H: 177mm<br>W: 256.5mm<br>D: 9.1mm</td><td align=center valign=middle>H: 177mm<br>W: 256.5mm<br>D: 8.9mm</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>Weight</td><td align=center valign=middle>617 grams</td><td align=center valign=middle>598 grams</td></tr><tr readability=5><td class=tlgrey>CPU</td><td align=center valign=middle>Intel Atom x5-Z8500 1.44-2.24 GHz quad-core 14nm Cherry Trail<br>Intel Atom x7-Z8700 1.6-2.4 GHz quad-core 14nm Cherry Trail</td><td align=center valign=middle>Intel Atom Z3795 1.59-2.39 GHz quad-core 22nm Bay Trail</td></tr><tr readability=5><td class=tlgrey>GPU</td><td align=center valign=middle>Intel HD Graphics (Gen 8 with 12 EUs on x5, 16 EUs on x7)</td><td align=center valign=middle>Intel HD Graphics (Gen 7 with 4 EUs)</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>RAM</td><td align=center valign=middle>2/4 GB LPDDR3</td><td align=center valign=middle>2/4 GB LPDDR3</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>Storage</td><td align=center valign=middle>64-128 GB eMMC</td><td align=center valign=middle>64-128 GB eMMC</td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=tlgrey>Display Size and Resolution</td><td align=center valign=middle>10.1" 1920x1200</td><td align=center valign=middle>10.1" 1920x1200</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>Battery</td><td align=center valign=middle>Rated at 10 hours, 32 Wh</td><td align=center valign=middle>Rated at 10 hours</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>Active Pen</td><td align=center valign=middle>ThinkPad Pen Pro</td><td align=center valign=middle>ThinkPad Pen Pro</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>Price at launch</td><td align=center valign=middle>$549</td><td align=center valign=middle>$599</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The ThinkPad 10 will ship with Windows 10 pre-installed, and the launch timeframe for the tablet is August 2015, which fits into the summer time frame that Microsoft has promised for Windows 10. The price at launch is $549 for the base model.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/9288/Lenovo%20Cast_01_575px.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>The second item launching today is the Lenovo Cast, which is a Miracast and DLNA module which can be connected to any television with HDMI. Lenovo is promoting the dual frequency Wi-Fi available on the Lenovo Cast as an upgrade over many of the other Miracast devices on the market today. Since it supports both DLNA and Miracast, it should work with almost any device which supports either of those standards. As with most of these devices, it is powered by micro USB to allow it to be powered off of a TV USB port. Lenovo is claiming that the device will support casting from up to 20 meters and through up to two walls, but that is not at 1080p, where it drops to 5 meters on 2.4 GHz or 15 meters on 5 GHz Wi-FI. The included Realtek wireless chip is the RTL 8192DU which is 802.11 a/b/g/n. The Lenovo Cast includes a 1 meter USB to micro USB cable, a 1 meter HDMI cable, and a bracket to mount the Lenovo Cast on the back of a television. At just 70mm x 15 mm (2.76 x 0.59 inches) and a weight of just 50 grams, it should be an easy accessory for travel too. The Lenovo Cast is launching in August for $49 USD with worldwide availability.</p><p>The ThinkPad 10 is a bit of a price premium for a tablet, but not excessively so, and hopefully we can get our hands on one to see how it compares to the Surface 3 which is the only other device around with Cherry Trail at the moment. I believe this is the first device that I have seen which has specifically stated it will launch with Windows 10 as well, and assuming Microsoft hits their time frame, Lenovo should not have to hold this device back.</p><p>There is a lot of competition in the casting space, but a small DLNA and Miracast device for $49 is, I think, a good price especially considering it comes with dual-band Wi-Fi and all of the necessary cables and even a mounting bracket.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZIZzhJdoo56mn6u8brjArqWcoJWoerW0yKeiqZmUYn5xedOamaWdpGK%2FprLRnqqhZZGjsW64xKemr6ddmK60wIyampydo6i8s8U%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jeepers-creepers-3-pr-disaster.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Jeepers Creepers 3 Contains A Molestation Subplot, And Tries To Justify It</span></a>
