Roller Boy Longo mentions Shadow Pokémon in overworld dialog, so it is possible he may have had one in his party. Interestingly, six of them are named after numbers, aligning with scrapped story dialog that refers to <i>Six Shadow Aipom Siblings</i>.</p><p>There are several unused Level 100 Pokémon teams with blank movesets that would have been used by the <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Snagem Head (Trainer class)">Snagem Head</a> class that also go completely unused.</p><p>Rui also interestingly has a Trainer headshot and model for standing behind Pokémon in battles, complete with an animation for losing.<a href=#>[2]</a></p><table><tbody readability=2><tr><td><a href=# class=image><img alt="Colo Chaser m.png" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/f/f7/Colo_Chaser_m.png/188px-Colo_Chaser_m.png decoding=async width=125 height=94 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a href=# class=image><img alt="Colo Lady 2.png" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/1/1d/Colo_Lady_2.png/188px-Colo_Lady_2.png decoding=async width=125 height=94 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a href=# class=image><img alt="Colo Rich Boy 2.png" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/d/d0/Colo_Rich_Boy_2.png/188px-Colo_Rich_Boy_2.png decoding=async width=125 height=94 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Unused Chaser B, Lady B, and Rich Boy B Vs. sprites</td></tr></tbody></table><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Abilities>Abilities</span></h3><p>An <a href=# title=Ability>Ability</a> known as <a href=# title="Cacophony (Ability)">Cacophony</a> is found within the internal data.

It is identical to <a href=# title="Soundproof (Ability)">Soundproof</a>, another sound-related Ability, allowing the Pokémon to avoid all <a href=# title="Sound-based move">sound-based moves</a>. Since it is identical to Soundproof, it was likely scrapped due to redundancy, and some Pokémon that have Soundproof may have originally been intended to have Cacophony instead, such as <a href=# title="Loudred (Pokémon)">Loudred</a> and <a href=# title="Exploud (Pokémon)">Exploud</a>, which are well known for their loudness.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Unobtainable_Shiny_Celebi>Unobtainable Shiny Celebi</span></h3><p>For the sake of consistency, and to prevent game crashes if they are hacked into the game, every Pokémon has a <a href=# title="Shiny Pokémon">Shiny variant</a>.
