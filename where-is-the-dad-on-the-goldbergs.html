Did he die?</h2><p>Months after Jeff Garlin's departure from The Goldbergs, we finally know how Murray Goldberg's story ends (sort of). Ahead of the Season 10 premiere, showrunners revealed a shocking spoiler. According to Alex Barnow and Chris Bishop, <a href=#>Garlin's character wasn't going to be replaced</a> — but instead, killed off.</p><p>In episodes to come, viewers will see the Goldberg family cope with this loss. However, as of now, we don't know exactly how Murray died. In Season 10's opening episode, they chose to not focus on the specifics of his death, instead just saying that he passed away.</p><p>“Just a few months ago, out of nowhere, we lost my dad,” Adam said. “We will always love you, Dad. Always. And we’ll find a way to continue on together. Because, after all, we’re the Goldbergs.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Showrunners said that with Murray's death comes the introduction of some new characters and "new cast dynamics" in Season 10 that will give the series a much-needed makeover. In addition, they also teased that the new season includes a <a href=#>cameo from '80s icon David Hasselhoff</a>.</p><p>"We can't think of anybody more emblematic of [the '80s]," Alex said of The Goldbergs guest star. "He's wearing the jacket, he's got the hair, he looks great. And we're using him in multiple episodes."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why did Jeff Garlin leave 'The Goldbergs'?</h2><p>Jeff Garlin's departure from The Goldbergs came as a result of an internal investigation into his alleged misconduct on set.</p><p>Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a>, sources who worked on The Goldbergs described him as "extremely verbally and emotionally abusive." The publication also cited an alleged instance of a staff member complaining about Garlin's language, prompting him to reportedly put his hands around her and say "vagina" in her face repeatedly.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Another example of his hostile behavior on set came when someone claimed he verbally attacked a married couple who worked on the show.</p><p>A source told Deadline, "He [Garlin] screamed at her, 'Why are you always in my way? Get the f--k out of my way,' as she was walking down the ramp on the set after they had done blocking for a scene. She was confused and looked around." The actor then reportedly turned to the woman's husband and said, "Tell your wife to get the f--k out of my way."</p><p>On Dec. 3, 2021, Jeff denied to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vanity Fair</a> that he had been fired from the show but acknowledged at the time that there were some HR probes being done into his conduct on set. Barely two weeks later, Deadline officially confirmed his departure, and the star hasn't worked on the set of The Goldbergs since.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWmvsRmoKxlpJ2ybrDAnWSopl2ptaZ5xqijnZqVp7S0</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-belle-rive-boutique-hotel-louangphabang-laos.html><span>←</span><span>The Belle Rive Boutique Hotel, Louangphabang, Laos</span></a>
