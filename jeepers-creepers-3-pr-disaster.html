But, mysteriously for a horror film being released around Halloween, I just couldn’t find a screening. I looked high and low for one, but for some weird reason the studio seemed to be keeping a very tight lid on things. Could the film really be that bad? Were they trying to bury it? Was it simply not finished?</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=449 data-current-count=449 data-injectable=true>Maybe&nbsp;it’s because the director, Victor Salva, is a convicted pedophile&nbsp;who molested a twelve-year-old boy on the set of his film Clownhouse&nbsp;(*shudder*) and was caught in possession of child porn, which led to him being sentenced to three years in prison (of which he only served 15 months).&nbsp;And now that word has (once again) gotten out about this, screenings of Jeepers Creepers 3&nbsp;are being threatened with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">demonstrations and&nbsp;boycotts</a>.</p><p data-characters=31 data-current-count=31 data-injectable=false>Yeah. It’s probably that.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Jeepers-Creepers-3-03.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Jeepers-Creepers-3-01.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Jeepers-Creepers-3-02.jpg><p data-characters=449 data-current-count=480 data-injectable=true>Perhaps proving that it’s not what you’ve done, it’s who you know, Salva picked himself up after the whole child rape thing and forged a successful career in Hollywood. He was responsible for Disney’s&nbsp;Powder&nbsp;(a film <a href=#>subsequently criticized</a> for symbolically defending Salva’s history) and two&nbsp;Jeepers Creepers&nbsp;movies. Now, he’s back, with&nbsp;Jeepers Creeper 3. Or he would be, if it was getting a proper release.</p><p data-characters=728 data-current-count=728 data-injectable=true>With several critics having already seen the threequel, we’ve learned that&nbsp;Salva wrote a molestation subplot into the film&nbsp;and launched a casting call to find someone willing to play a 13-year-old girl fleeing her abusive stepfather. During the casting process, <a href=#>the Union of British Columbian Performers even put out a notice to warn parents</a> of the director’s conviction. From what we understand, the&nbsp;screener supplied to critics contains a scene in which someone says of the abuser, “Can you blame him though? I mean look at her,” and that one character justifies his actions by saying, “The heart wants what it wants, am I right?” (Not sure Woody Allen is the best person to quote here).</p><p data-characters=409 data-current-count=409 data-injectable=false>All this leaves a distinctly bad taste in the mouth for anyone who manages to find a screening of Jeepers Creepers 3 – <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">which is&nbsp;by all accounts a pretty terrible moviegoing experience</a>. Naturally, though, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Salva is already hard at work</a> on&nbsp;<strong>Jeepers Creepers 4</strong>, which will probably be&nbsp;about a misunderstood monster called Sictor Valva who’s cruelly tempted by those annoyingly sexy 12-year-old boys.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJooZ6doJq%2FtHnCq5yeqJWnwG5%2FjKmpZpyZqK60wMSrZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./733984-earl-thomas-identity-theft.html><span>←</span><span>Earl Thomas Victim Of $1.9M Identity Theft Scheme Allegedly Run By Ex-Wife's Boyfriend</span></a>
