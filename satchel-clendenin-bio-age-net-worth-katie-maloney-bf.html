She didn’t expect to keep hanging out with him after their initial meeting.</p><p>Katie initially said she kept her budding relationship with Satchel under wraps out of respect for her ex-husband, but after Schwartz decided to disregard Katie’s request to avoid dating anyone in their common buddy group, everything changed.

Lala said that Katie was “beaming” while cozying up to Satchel, but Scheana was a bit more critical. “It’s weird seeing Katie with this mactor, shaggy dog-looking motherf*cker,” Scheana said in a confessional. “I mean, he looks like he just got groomed at Vanderpump Dogs.”</p><p>But Katie hesitated to introduce Satchel as her boyfriend. In February, Katie announced that she was “single”&nbsp;on her Instagram Story, even laughing off&nbsp;dating rumors&nbsp;with newly engaged&nbsp;Lukas Gage, and told Andy Cohen on&nbsp;Watch What Happens Live&nbsp;that she has a type while dating. “They’re all young; I like it,” Katie said. “The young ones are kind of where it’s at.”</p><p>According to&nbsp;Bravo,&nbsp;Katie had teased that she was having&nbsp;a&nbsp;“casual thing” with a younger guy in the fall of 2022.
