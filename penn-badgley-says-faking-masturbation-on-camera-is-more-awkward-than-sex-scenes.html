I have to say sometimes those scenes are harder than with (another) person.”</p><p>In ‘You’, Penn plays serial stalker Joe Goldberg who turns to murder and he admitted directors were worried he was making the solo sex act scenes look too “creepy”.</p><p>He added: “Every time I’ve done a masturbation scene … I’ve always gotten the note to make it less creepy.</p><p>“They say like, ‘Close your eyes or go faster or go slower.’ I’m like, ‘What? This man is f*****g murdering people, and he’s masturbating in the street. You’re saying I’m making it creepy? How is it I’m the one making it creepy?’”</p><p>The actor revealed his colleagues thought keeping his eyes open during those scenes was part of the problem.</p><p>He explained: “I just remember I wouldn’t close my eyes and the director came up to me. He was like, ‘Buddy, I think you gotta close your eyes’. “</p><p>However, Penn was adamant being creepy was “the f*****g point” of his character.</p><p>Penn has starred in three seasons of the hit show and filming on the fourth series kicked off in London back in March.</p><p>New episodes are believed to be scheduled to drop on the streaming service in late 2022.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOqZynpl2XrqWzy56wZquRrsBussCkoKefXaKutMDUq5marJmku267zWaamqWVp65utdJmpKiqlWKuuLfWmqmdZaSdrq950p6vZquTmrumv44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mabosstiff.html><span>←</span><span>Mabosstiff (Pokmon) - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</span></a>
