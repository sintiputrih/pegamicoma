While Jen started out the night in a strappy black Santoni sandals, she soon ditched them for white trainers with red laces from Brooks Running that expertly matched her dress. She finished off her evening look with ruby-and-gold chandelier earrings, a diamond bracelet and ring, and a dark red manicure.&nbsp;<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Her shoulder-length brunette hair was worn down and swept to the side with flipped-out ends, and she complemented her rosy glow with a swipe of pink lipgloss.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While on the red carpet, Garner spoke about her new project — in which she plays a mom who switches bodies with her teen daughter (played by Emma Myers) — and revealed she didn't have to go far to research the role during an interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>People</a>. "I definitely went to my teens and asked a bunch of questions," said Jen, who shares three children — Violet, 17, Seraphina, 13, and 11-year-old Samuel with her ex-husband Ben Affleck. "They were all like, 'Mom, you're crazy.'"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When asked if she would want to switch lives with any of her kids, she answered: "You know what? I think my kids work so hard, and they have so much pressure on them that I could never even have imagined as a teenager myself," adding: "I’ll stay right here in my old lady body, thank you very much."&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57yZ6lp6GWmr9us8CrpZ6qXaeypXnMoqWinKKawLR50qecmqOVp8BussCmoKWxXajEqsDCoWSpqpWitqa%2BxGZvbWhoaIV6</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./baby-names.html><span>←</span><span>Delphia: Name Meaning and Origin</span></a>
