Hoda previously opened up about working with Savannah during a chat with Good Housekeeping magazine.&nbsp;</p><p id=eYQCHejJmi data-wc=75>She said: "I have some nights where I really messed up and I know I did. And I come in the next morning [thinking], I feel terrible for what I did. What was I thinking? Why did I think that was going to work? They went to bed crying. Like, I don't want that to be me. But then I talk to Savannah. She'll say, 'That was my Wednesday,' it makes you feel less alone."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/aab3606057e9-gettyimages-1702924334.jpg><p id=e2TeEw-W9r data-wc=17>Hoda joined Savannah on the show after former Today Show host Matt Lauer was fired in 2017.&nbsp;</p><p id=eu7QriIWYs data-wc=47>In 2022, Savannah discussed her working partnership with Hoda during a celebration for the show at The Paley Center. On Hoda replacing Matt, she said: "All I know was in that moment, it felt like I could drown if Hoda hadn't reached down and grabbed my hand."&nbsp;</p><p id=eohDdZBf3L data-wc=39>She added: "I will always say she saved the show full stop. And holding hands with her and being like, 'We're going to do this together,' meant everything to me. I don't think I had the confidence by myself."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6496f776ceff-snapinstaapp412368642184054616740088933882030805955821309n1080.jpg><p id=eHrpnmmfO8 data-wc=37>Savannah will be supported by Hoda once again as she kicks off her book tour, which kicks off later this week. The pair will be chatting about the book on Thursday February 22 in New York City.&nbsp;</p><p id=e0R5ikBuAP data-wc=43>The book, as per Amazon is described as "Mostly What God Does is centered on the essentials of God's love, a love that is needed now more than ever. Savannah Guthrie turns her journalistic eye toward the power of faith in everyday life."&nbsp;</p><p id=evPl9xaQKx data-wc=43>The Christian literature will share reflections on faith and life and aims to be an inspiring read. Savannah is deeply spiritual and delved into her beliefs in an essay for Today which was adapted from a speech she gave at a Catholic luncheon.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/379a561d9b9c-cover-mostly-what-god-does-guthrie.jpg><p id=eIa-qGl1RU data-wc=37>"Motherhood and faith go together," she wrote. "I couldn’t do one without the other. You need faith to get through motherhood. Wine helps. But faith is crucial. "Motherhood tells us everything we need to know about faith.&nbsp;</p><p id=e-GpyGAfZe data-wc=51>"Being a parent teaches us in the clearest terms how God, our Father in heaven, relates to us. His love, his frustrations, his compassion for us … The way we feel about our kids is about as close as we can get to grasping how God feels about us, His children."</p><p id=eav2XfkoAn data-wc=6>Read more <a class=hm-link href=#>HELLO!
