Loughlin and her husband, Mossimo Giannulli, a distinguished fashion designer, were found guilty of plotting to admit their two daughters into the University of Southern California as part of the rowing team even though neither had any prior involvement in the sport.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/c0dbebe2c54ea75103508e0883d0505b3f50ceab178383d5dec70accf457ca60.jpg><p class=Vi data-testid=image-source>Lori Loughlin as Becky and John Stamos as Jesse on "Full House" on September 14, 1993 | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Fg>The couple had paid a hefty sum of $500,000 to secure their children's admission to the university.

Throughout this period, she was obligated to carry out 100 hours of community service and remit a penalty of $150,000.</p><p class=Fg>After serving nearly two months in prison for her role in the scandal, Loughlin was <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/crime/lori-loughlin-released-prison-college-admissions-scandal/>released</a>. The scheme to unfairly get students admitted to elite universities wasn't the only scandal making headlines at the time.

Giannulli was on spring break during her first year when she learned about her parents' arrest.

The public backlash was intense, and Giannulli faced criticism for her parents' actions and her privilege. This series of events prompted her to temporarily withdraw from her social media channels, including YouTube and Instagram.</p><p class=Fg>The emotional stress of seeing <a class="Xd a" href=#>her parents</a> arrested, charged, and sentenced to prison was also immense. In December 2020, before her parents' release, she appeared on an episode of "Red Table Talk" to share her perspective. During the show, she expressed her feelings about her parents' actions.</p><p class=Fg>She believed her parents did it because her father was too attached to his children and wanted her and her sister, Isabella Rose Giannulli, to attend school close to home.

She acknowledged that what happened was wrong and that every family member agreed it was a big mistake.</p><p class=Fg>She stated that she had worked hard in high school and was involved in her college application process, admitting that she was unaware of many aspects of the situation. She <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.facebook.com/redtabletalk/videos/298151528184131/>said</a>, "I think what's so important to me is to learn from the mistake, not to now be shamed and punished and never given a second chance."</p><p class=Fg>She stated that she was oblivious to her privilege during the scandal. Giannulli acknowledged that the image painted of her in the media was not who she was and expressed understanding towards the anger and hurtful comments from the public. In an attempt to change her image and give back, she volunteered at an after-school program for underprivileged children.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/c0637416b83f5912d8561171b13ed64d48a82fbc5cd4de4cf7a6b02d09b2f89d.jpg><p class=Vi data-testid=image-source>Lori Loughlin with daughter Olivia Giannulli attend the "Happily N'Ever After" Los Angeles premiere in Westwood, California | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Fg>Before the scandal, Loughlin had expressed her desire for her children to attend college.
