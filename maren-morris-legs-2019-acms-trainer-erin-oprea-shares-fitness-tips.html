But the star inspired fans with something new at the 54th annual Academy of Country Music Awards on Sunday, April 7: the fitness routine that led to her incredibly toned legs.</p><p>Wearing a lavender, off-the-shoulder Christian Siriano gown with a flowing train and super high hemline, “The Middle” singer — who was nominated for Female Artist of the Year, which <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Kacey Musgraves</strong></a> took home — flashed thighs and calves so sculpted, that Us Weekly went to her trainer <strong>Erin Oprea</strong> to find out exactly how she got them.</p><p>“We do lots of Tabatas,” Oprea tells Us of the HIIT variation that consists of eight rounds of strenuous exercise in intervals of 20 seconds followed by 10 seconds of rest for a total of four minutes. “They are super effective, they turn fitness into a game and they are killer for your legs — or anywhere else on your body, for that matter!”</p><p>While the actual moves Oprea does with Morris in her Tabatas are simple, they also make for an exhausting fitness regimen. “We do a lot of variations on lunges and squats — with or without weights, jumping or not jumping — pulses and full range of motion movements,” she says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Erin-Oprea-Maren-Morris-working-out.jpg><p>The 28-year-old’s workouts last for an hour. And while the number of times a week she meets with her Nashville-based trainer vary based on her schedule, Oprea thinks three <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">strength-training sessions</a> a week is ideal. “My goal for all my clients is to do strength training three days a week with cardio thrown in on the other days,” the 4×4 Diet author explains. “But I really believe in all-day movement every day, like with my <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">StepBet game</a>, which is a fun and easy way to be accountable for getting your steps in every day.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The former Marine — whose clients include <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Carrie Underwood</strong></a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Jana Kramer </strong></a>and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Kelsea Ballerini</strong></a>&nbsp;— also believes eating right is necessary to see results. “No matter how hard you work out, you can’t out-train a bad diet,” she advises. “It’s important to eat clean to reach your goals.”</p><p>For Morris — currently on her 2019 tour, Girl: The World Tour — staying active isn’t a problem. She’ll even FaceTime Oprea for sessions (like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ballerini does too</a>!) on the road or follow <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tabata routines</a> online. “She is a hard worker! When she is training, she is completely there, kicking butt in the gym for the whole workout,” gushes the pro. “She is a super hard-working woman!”</p><p>Adds Oprea, “Her goals are no different from other women. She wants to feel strong and she wants to feel her absolute best.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGammaKau265zqupoqtdobKov4xrZ2pxXZawrr%2BMramaoZ6av26x0aKlZqegp7KiedKhmKudo2KzqsDNnqqsZaSevbR7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-scoey-mitchells-wife-still-alive.html><span>←</span><span>Is Scoey Mitchells wife still alive?</span></a>
