So, you know, I would prefer to have more of a coparent, but he’s not interested. But we’re getting through it.”</p><p>Shannon has since moved on romantically with <a href=#><strong>John Janssen</strong></a>, whom Us confirmed in July 2019 she had begun dating. She also revealed that she “absolutely” <a href=#>wants to get married again</a> but she’s “not in any rush” to walk down the aisle.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadmaaesW6uxJqbqKpdoq6zvsieqmaoopq0r63NrWSlnaOhsrp5wqimpGWRm8GmvoxsZLKdkafAbrvFZpuarJmjtHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./daniel-padilla-biography-songs-family-net-worth-and-kathryn-bernardo.html><span>←</span><span>Daniel Padilla Biography, Songs, Family, Net Worth and Kathryn Bernardo</span></a>
