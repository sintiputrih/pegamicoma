In addition, we'll take a look at how little she has aged since the show came to an end.</p><h2 id=maggie-wheeler-39-s-39-friends-39-audition-came-at-the-perfect-time>Maggie Wheeler's 'Friends' Audition Came At The Perfect Time</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The opportunity came knocking at the perfect time for Maggie Wheeler. She was just let go from the Ellen DeGeneres Show, and at point, <a href=#>Wheeler was down, looking for another chance.</a></p><p>"I had been on the first season of the Ellen DeGeneres show and I had a great time working on that show – in the beginning, it was called These Friends Of Mine – and I was fired from that show, I was devastated,” spilled Wheeler. “I was so shaken by it, it was an unthinkable thing as an actor, (but) I felt in a way liberated to do the work I wanted to do without fear or favor.''</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>'Friends' Fans Have No Idea One Of The Show's Stars Almost Left The Series Early</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Wheeler admits, she felt free during the audition and this might've played a huge role in landing the gig, “On any other day I might have done the (Friends) audition differently, but it came hot on the heels of that and I felt free and decided to do what I wanted to do on that day and it worked in my favor.” she also said that “(Friends) wouldn’t have happened if I hadn’t had to go through the fire.”</p><p>As they say, the rest is history, and Wheeler would thrive on the show as Janice, though believe it or not, it was initially meant to be a one-off appearance.</p><h2 id=wheeler-39-s-39-friends-39-episode-was-supposed-to-be-a-one-off>Wheeler's 'Friends' Episode Was Supposed To Be A One-Off</h2><p>She became an iconic character on the show and in truth, a lot of it had to do with her voice and catchphrase,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Oh my God." According to Wheeler, <a href=#>she came up with this all in a bid to give Matthew Perry a laugh</a>.</p><p>“The voice, I just made the decision where I saw the audition scene,” Wheeler said.</p><p>“It was the scene where she brings Chandler socks - so I really made the decision about the voice in advance.</p><p>“I created the laugh because Matthew Perry is so funny, and I knew he was going to make me laugh on set.</p><p>“And I thought, Janice better have a laugh because he’ll crack me up every time we work together - so that’s how that happened.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Fans Think This Is Why 'Friends' Only Did One Halloween Episode</a></span></p><p>In addition, she was only set for one episode, however, given the love the show and fans had for her, <a href=#>she was able to return</a> and became an iconic guest star.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>''It was not planned at all. My first episode was the only episode. It was just one job, one day and one week, that’s it. How fortunate for me that they fell in love with the character and the chemistry between me and Matthew. That was so unexpected and such a gift."</p><p>These days, although she's not as prominent in the sitcom world, she's still making a difference and in addition, she really hasn't aged one bit.</p><h2 id=wheeler-turned-60-recently-but-hasn-39-t-aged-a-day>Wheeler Turned 60 Recently But Hasn't Aged A Day</h2><p>It is hard to believe but in the summer, Janice turned 60!
