Her parents have only one child. Her father, Ed, worked as a sales manager for a country radio station, and her mother, Carla, worked in marketing for Thomas Nelson Bible Publications and Sponsorship Company. And <strong>she is now 29 years old.</strong></p><p>She started taking dance lessons at Premiere Dance Studio in Seymour when she was three years old and continued for ten years. She wrote her first song for her mother when she was 12 years old and moved to Nashville, Tennessee, three years later. In addition, she wrote a song about her mother as a present for her. Kelsea’s mother was crying as she listened to the album, and that was the turning point in her life. She knew she could make a living as a musician. Kelsea quickly began singing in church and school choirs, and her newfound faith aided her in pursuing a career in music.</p><p>She adores dogs and has a dog called ‘Dibs,’ which she named after her hit single of the same name. In terms of education, she attended Central High School in Knoxville and Centennial High School in Frankin before graduating. She also enrolled at Lipscomb University in Nashville. She spent two years there studying communications and marketing before starting to pursue a career in music. And she’ll keep following her artistic ambitions.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=quick-facts></span>Quick Facts<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><table class="table table-striped facts" style=height:100%;width:100%><tbody><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Full Name</th><td style=height:24px>Kelsea Ballerini</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Born Date</th><td style=height:24px>12 Sep 1993</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Age</th><td style=height:24px>29 years</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Horoscope</th><td style=height:24px>Virgo</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Lucky Number</th><td style=height:24px>7</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Lucky Stone</th><td style=height:24px>Sapphire</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Lucky Color</th><td style=height:24px>Green</td></tr><tr style=height:48px><th style=height:48px>Best Match for Marriage</th><td style=height:48px>Taurus, Capricorn</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Gender</th><td style=height:24px>Female</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Profession</th><td style=height:24px>singer, song-writer, country singer</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Country</th><td style=height:24px>United States</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Height</th><td style=height:24px>5 feet 6 inches (1.68m)</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Weight</th><td style=height:24px>54 kg</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Marital Status</th><td style=height:24px>married</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Married Date</th><td style=height:24px>December 2, 2017</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Husband</th><td style=height:24px>Morgan Evans</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Net Worth</th><td style=height:24px>$6 million</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Eye Color</th><td style=height:24px>Green</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Hair Color</th><td style=height:24px>Blonde</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Body Size</th><td style=height:24px>33-24-34</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Birth Place</th><td style=height:24px>Mascot, Tennessee</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Nationality</th><td style=height:24px>American</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Ethnicity</th><td style=height:24px>English, Italian</td></tr><tr style=height:48px><th style=height:48px>Education</th><td style=height:48px>Centennial High School, Knoxville Central High School, Lipscomb University</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Father</th><td style=height:24px>Ed</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Mother</th><td style=height:24px>Carla</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Facebook</th><td style=height:24px>Kelsea Ballerini Facebook</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Twitter</th><td style=height:24px>Kelsea Ballerini Twitter</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Youtube</th><td style=height:24px>Kelsea Ballerini Youtube</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Instagram</th><td style=height:24px>Kelsea Ballerini Instagram</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Personal Web</th><td style=height:24px>Kelsea Ballerini Personal Web</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>IMDB</th><td style=height:24px>Kelsea Ballerini IMDB</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Wiki</th><td style=height:24px>Kelsea Ballerini Wiki</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Brands</th><td style=height:24px>N/A</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Hobbies</th><td style=height:24px>N/A</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=kelsea-ballerini-height-weight></span><span id=Kelsea_Ballerinis_Height_Weight_Body_Measurement class=ez-toc-section>Kelsea Ballerini </span><b>Height & Weight</b><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>What is Kelsea Ballerini’s Height?</strong> She stands 5 feet 6 inches tall and weighs 54 kilograms. Virgo is her zodiac sign. Her hair is blonde, and her eyes are a beautiful green color. Similarly, she has sculpted her body to be extremely slim.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=professional-life-career></span><b>Professional Life & Career</b><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>She signed her first professional music contract, ‘Black River Entertainment,’ in 2013 when she was 19 years old. Her debut single, “Love Me Like You Mean It,” was released in October 2014. Kelsea has collaborated on the album with Josh Kerr and a few other writers. On the Billboard Country Airplay chart, this song reached number one. Chelsea became the first female country artist signed to an independent label to reach the top of the charts with this song.</p><p>Similarly, her album ‘The First Time,’ which was released in May 2015, featured the main track ‘Love Me As You Mean It.’ Kelsea released her debut self-titled EP in November 2014, which was well-received by critics. Kelsea’s popularity grew as a result of the album’s success.</p><p>Furthermore, Kelsea’s songs revealed a more mature side to her personality, and it seems that the majority of her songs were influenced by real-life events, such as her parent’s divorce and the heartbreaks she experienced. The first three singles from her debut studio album, “The First Time,” namely “CO,” “Peter Pan,” and “Love Me As You Mean It,” all charted at number one on the “Billboard Country Airplay” chart, making her the first new female artist to have her first three singles chart at number one. Furthermore, the album was well-received upon its initial release, but it was criticized for being too flirty. The single Peter Pan was a huge hit, and Kelsea even performed it at the Academy of Country Music Awards.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=more-on-career></span>More On Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Furthermore, after “Love Me Like You Mean It,” her other song from the album, “Dibs,” became the album’s second-most popular single. As a result of the success of her debut album, she became a sought-after performer. A few reviewers have lavished praise on the album. Kelsea’s musical sensibilities were also compared to Taylor Swift’s. Furthermore, as of October 2017, the album had sold over 300,000 copies in the United States. The Recording Industry Association of America awarded it “gold” status over time (RIAA).</p><p>Kelsea became a sought-after artist following the success of her debut album. Alan Jackson, Lady Antebellum, Tim McGraw, and Keith Urban are among the country music icons with whom she has collaborated. Kelsea has headlined her own tour to promote her debut album to a wider audience. Ballerini was ranked second on Forbes’ 30 under 30 – Music list in early 2017. She entered the fifteenth season of The Voice as the fifth coach at the end of 2018.</p><p>Ballerini released the first single from her forthcoming third album, titled “Homecoming Queen?” on September 6, 2019. The single debuted at number 22 on the Country Airplay chart, giving her her best chart debut to date. She announced her self-titled album (Kelsea) on January 20, 2020, and it was released on March 20, 2020. On February 28, she re-released the single “Hole in the Bottle” (stylized in all lowercase) and revealed the Kelsea tracklist, which included Kenny Chesney’s “Half of My Hometown” and Halsey’s “The Other Girl.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=kelsea-ballerini-husband-marriage></span>Kelsea Ballerini Husband & Marriage<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Who is Kelsea Ballerini’s Husband?</strong> In March 2016, she began dating Australian country singer Morgan Evans.
