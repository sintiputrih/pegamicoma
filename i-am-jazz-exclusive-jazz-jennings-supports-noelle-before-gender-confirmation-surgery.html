Noelle’s mother greets the Jennings at the door.</p><p>And although Noelle’s mom and dad are smiling, Noelle can’t stop her tears as Jazz heads to hug her. Noelle remains seated, explaining that the fasting required before surgery makes her “winded.”</p><p>When Jazz speculates that Noelle must be hungry, thinking that might account for her emotional state, her friend tearfully confesses that she is “just grateful to be alive.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/I-Am-Jazz-Jazz-Jennings-Preview.jpg><p>Like Jazz, Noelle waited for her surgery for a long time, and the teen is “so happy” to have her family and the Jennings mom and daughter by her side.</p><h2>Does Noelle succeed with gender confirmation surgery fundraiser with Jazz and Jeanette Jennings’ help?</h2><p>One of the big obstacles for gender confirmation surgery, in addition to getting the support of family and friends, lies in the cost of the procedure. With Jazz and the Jennings’ family helping out, Noelle had a fundraiser for her surgery.</p><p>But did she reach her goal? As our exclusive preview clip for I Am Jazz shows, the answer is yes! Jazz shares the news to Noelle and her family, with her friend crying with joy and relief.</p><p>In one of the show’s most heartfelt moments, Noelle shared her appreciation for Jazz as a “loving and caring” friend. And as Noelle points out, sadly, it’s not easy to find friends like Jazz in this world.</p><p>&nbsp;I Am Jazz airs Tuesdays at 9/8c on TLC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWiqlZa5qsDYZquvZ5lirq55yZqxs2WVrbCtwdKirZ5lmpbHu3nJnqWnoZ6cwG6%2F1KmnqKqkqHqvu8Slo55lkpqzsL7EZp6eppSav26vzqedoqqdlsGqu81mqq6ql5q%2Funs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./diarra-sylla.html><span>←</span><span>Diarra Sylla Bio, Net Worth, Height, In Relation, Nationality, Facts</span></a>
