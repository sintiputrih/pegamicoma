It’s one of the worst <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">true crime</a></strong> stories <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Florida</a></strong> has ever seen, so why did they do it?</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=251 data-current-count=251 data-injectable=false>It’s a savage crime that left investigators scratching their heads, and the general public shocked by the brutality of it all. Like many crimes, things went sideways and the assailants didn’t even get what they were looking for in the end.</p><p data-characters=397 data-current-count=648 data-injectable=true>Even worse, more than ten of the couple’s disabled foster children were in the house when the break-in happened. One of them witnessed their father get shot. A total of five men broke into the house, with one waiting outside to drive everyone away. When it was all over, Bud and Melanie lay dead, and eventually all the perpetrators involved were captured and given lengthy prison sentences.</p><p data-characters=140 data-current-count=140 data-injectable=false>No one came out ahead, and a bunch of special needs children lost their wealthy, loving parents. Let’s get to know them a little more.</p><h2 id=h-who-were-bud-and-melanie-billings data-injectable=false>Who were Bud and Melanie Billings?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/bud-and-melinda-youtube.jpeg><p data-characters=220 data-current-count=220 data-injectable=false>Byrd “Bud” Billings was 66 years old when he passed and his wife, Melinda, was 43. He was an entrepreneur who even owned a strip club before settling in as a used car dealer, a job that made him very wealthy.</p><p data-characters=276 data-current-count=496 data-injectable=true>He divorced his second wife and married Melinda just just four months later. They lived in a very nice $700,000 home in Pensacola, Florida. Melanie loved country music and feeding the homeless. She had a good heart and that rubbed off on Bud, who had more of a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">checkered past</a>.</p><p data-characters=391 data-current-count=391 data-injectable=false>They met at Bud’s strip club when he hired Melanie as a waitress. They got married in 1993, and both expressed a desire to have a lot of children. The couple both had two kids from previous marriages. At one point, 13 children lived in their home, but around the time of the murder, they lived with nine children, aged from 4 to 11, with various developmental issues and special needs.</p><p data-characters=73 data-current-count=464 data-injectable=true>One family friend said they were a “modern-life Brady Bunch.”</p><h2 data-injectable=false>What happened on the night Bud and Melanie Billings were murdered?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=243 data-current-count=543 data-injectable=true>Melanie’s adult child, Ashley Markham, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">made a call</a> on July 9, 2009 to check up on her mom and her adopted siblings. It was around 7:30 p.m. and one of the children, Jacob, who was 10 at the time and had Down Syndrome, answered the phone.</p><p data-characters=399 data-current-count=399 data-injectable=false>He was in shock. He passed the phone to his autistic sister Ashley, and she relayed that her parents were simply laying on the floor. A distraught Ashley called a neighbor to go check on them, and sped over to the house. The neighbor discovered the bodies and called police. When Ashley got there, it was an active crime scene, with police officers everywhere. No one knew exactly what had happened.</p><p data-characters=328 data-current-count=727 data-injectable=true>Less than an hour earlier, Bud and Melanie were still alive. At around 7 p.m., a red van <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">pulled up</a> to the house and seven men dressed like ninjas rushed into the home from the front and back doors. They had been planning this heist for a month, and were told they were stealing from a drug dealer who kept millions in the house.</p><p data-characters=281 data-current-count=281 data-injectable=false>It was supposed to come off with military precision. It did not. The Billings had 16 cameras around the house, not for security, but to keep an eye on the children in case something went wrong. Those cameras would prove to be pivotal in the eventual identification of the robbers.</p><p data-characters=210 data-current-count=491 data-injectable=true>Bud was just in his living room watching TV when the assailants broke in. A surveillance camera caught that moment too. They broke the back door and the front door at the same time, rushed in, and zip-tied Bud.</p><p data-characters=69 data-current-count=69 data-injectable=false>The assailants carried rifles, and were dressed in all black clothes.</p><p data-characters=245 data-current-count=314 data-injectable=false>For some reason, Bud was shot in both legs, then dragged into the master bedroom – the one room in the house without cameras. One of the kids, aged around 6 or 7, stood and watched as the man shot his dad in the legs and then dragged him off.</p><p data-characters=155 data-current-count=469 data-injectable=true>The whole thing took about ten minutes. They were only in the house for four minutes, and in that time, both Melanie and Bud were murdered execution style.</p><p data-characters=193 data-current-count=193 data-injectable=false>Nine children were home when the burglars broke in. While none of them were physically harmed, the three that witnessed the break-in have had to cope with that mental trauma their whole lives.</p><p data-characters=396 data-current-count=589 data-injectable=true>So did the robbers make it out with millions? Well, they were on the hunt for a safe that supposedly contained incredible amounts of cash. There were actually two safes in the house. One safe contained $160,000 in cash with some antique jewelry to boot. Did they find that one? The eight person crew (a driver and a woman who helped plan the heist included) would’ve netted about $15k each.</p><p data-characters=234 data-current-count=234 data-injectable=false>Not really enough to justify what they ended up doing, but definitely better than nothing. Only they never found that safe. They found a different safe, this one full of children’s adoption documents, and some sentimental value.</p><p data-characters=127 data-current-count=361 data-injectable=false>Imagine planning a heist for months, botching it by killing two people, and then getting away with no money. That had to sting.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>How did the Bud and Melanie Billings killers get caught?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=661 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=283 data-current-count=283 data-injectable=false>The main thing investigators had to go on was the van. The men, even though they didn’t get away with any money, were in gloves and fairly cognizant of leaving clues. There was also a black boot mark on the door from when it was kicked in, but the van showed the most promise.</p><p data-characters=288 data-current-count=571 data-injectable=true>It showed up pretty clearly in the surveillance footage. The Escambia sheriff’s office talked to local news and sent out an alert for people to be on the lookout for a red van matching that description. Then they got a tip that someone saw behind a shed on someone’s property.</p><p data-characters=250 data-current-count=250 data-injectable=false>The call came in on July 11, two days after the murders. It was at the home of a man named Leonard Gonzalez, who initially said the van didn’t work. Investigators also found a shoe box for black combat boots similar to the boot mark they found.</p><p data-characters=250 data-current-count=500 data-injectable=true>When investigators told Leonard he was facing the death penalty, he spilled the beans. He told investigators about the six other men involved, including his son Patrick. He said it was all about cash and never about murder, but things went sideways.</p><p data-characters=276 data-current-count=276 data-injectable=false>Patrick denied everything but investigators found Walmart footage of Patrick buying black clothes and boots. That led them to more names: Wayne Coldiron, Donnie , and Gary Summer. Then Patrick broke. All left now were two more suspects: Rakeem Florence and Frederick Thornton.</p><p data-characters=203 data-current-count=479 data-injectable=true>Those two quickly turned on Patrick, saying he was the ringleader and trigger man, and that they were each offered about $3,000 to help. There was just one more piece: Where were the guns, and the safe?</p><p data-characters=216 data-current-count=216 data-injectable=false>Turns out they needed to talk to a realtor named Pamela Long Wiggins, who would hire Patrick as sort of an enforcer when she needed rent collected. She was captured on her yacht, purportedly trying to flee to Mexico.</p><p data-characters=335 data-current-count=551 data-injectable=false>Wiggins was the last arrest. She admitted to disposing of the weapons, and the safe was found on her Florida property, after she agreed to a plea deal. In fact, everyone agreed to plea deals except Patrick, who would go to trial, lose, and be sentenced to death. Leonard and Wiggins both died in prison. Patrick is still on death row.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekp8KmecKroKadX6y1unnWnqmeZZykw6q6xmannqajlrCwuMBmnairpJq%2FbrzAq5ynrKNir7awjJqlnWWdmrmiusieZJuhnKG2r7PSZqSuqpSav6awjJuwZpldnL%2Bwwc9mpp9lkae6prCMppynZZmjerW0xKKpZqCforJw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-is-there-a-green-spot-on-my-nail-html.html><span>←</span><span>Why is there a green spot on my nail?</span></a>
