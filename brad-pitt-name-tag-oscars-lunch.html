Dressed in a dusty-brown suit and an off-white polo, Pitt humbly introduced himself while wearing a name tag that read in all-caps bold type, "<strong>BRAD PITT</strong>," probably in hopes that more people would learn his name, or that he would get the opportunity to be in more movies, or both.</p><img alt="92nd Oscars Nominees Luncheon - Inside" title="92nd Oscars Nominees Luncheon - Inside" width=3000 height=2063 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/brad-pitt-attends-the-92nd-oscars-nominees-luncheon-on-news-photo-1580307182.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Kevork Djansezian</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Pitt puts his name tag on with a little help.</p><img alt=US-ENTERTAINMENT-OSCARS-NOMINEES-LUNCHEON title=US-ENTERTAINMENT-OSCARS-NOMINEES-LUNCHEON width=4219 height=3018 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/actor-brad-pitt-talks-with-british-actress-cynthia-erivo-news-photo-1580306998.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">ROBYN BECK</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Brad Pitt, wearing his name tag, chats with Cynthia Erivo, who is not wearing a name tag.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In all seriousness, though, Pitt—who's earned <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a30517035/brad-pitt-oscars/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="seven Oscar nominations" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">seven Oscar nominations</a> and has been the Hollywood heartthrob since before Gen Zers were born—needs no introduction. We could spot him from a mile away, even when he's casually incognito (which the paparazzi have been doing for years). Fans online did, however, appreciate the seeming humility that Pitt's gesture represented: He's not too big of a star to wear a name tag, in case you don't know who he is.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Fellow nominees including De Niro, Theron, Renée Zellweger, Cynthia Erivo, Jonathan Pryce, and Greta Gerwig didn't wear name tags. Young stars like Little Women's Florence Pugh and 1917's Dean-Charles Chapman and George MacKay, and directors Noah Baumbach and Todd Phillips did. Leonardo DiCaprio most certainly did not wear a name tag, but he did wear a pair of spiffy dark shades indoors.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Watch Pitt (although probably sans name tag) at the 2020 Oscars on Sunday, February 9, at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/67055711-c808-4a4d-811a-e7155a2bce10_1667409691.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Erica Gonzales" title="Headshot of Erica Gonzales" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Erica Gonzales is the Senior Culture Editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage on TV, movies, music, books, and more.
