Every little girl has them,” she said while standing next to her boyfriend, <strong>YBN Almighty Jay</strong>.</p><p>In regards to people’s reactions, she said: “I don’t care! Not at all.”</p><p>When the cameraman asked why people found it so offensive, she said: “Listen, I don’t care, my guy.”</p><p>Fans wrote in the comments section of her post on Wednesday. One user wrote: “It’s not necessary and it’s a baby. Not a doll to play to play with.” Others defended her saying that they are just clip-ons.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Chyna, who shares Dream with <strong><a href=#>Rob Kardashian</a></strong> and son King, 5, with ex <strong><a href=#>Tyga</a></strong>, has been vocal about being overprotective when it comes to her children. She was recently <a href=#>involved in an altercation</a> at Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia, California, on Easter Sunday with another park guest.</p><p>She later addressed the situation, which was caught on video, on social media. “Being famous is hard enough dealing with scrutiny but when someone feels comfortable to come and touch your child it’s a whole other story,” she wrote in a post on her Instagram Story. “I do not condone violence nor am I a violent person but shout out to all of the amazing mothers out there that will protect their children at all cost. Love, King and Dreams mommy.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGabpJGYeqS02KeYZpyVm7KvsNJmm6udkaJ6qa3Iq2SesKSau7S1zqeqaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./anna-todd-spodek-wife-margaret-spodek.html><span>←</span><span>Anna Todd Spodek Wife Margaret Spodek: Who Is She?
