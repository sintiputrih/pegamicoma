The pair, who both work in electrical and IT fields, have been programming their home's Christmas lights to music for four years.
It started in 2013, when they saw another local display and began researching how it worked.
&#34;It seemed a lot simpler,&#34; said Wayne, a New Milford native.
But the father-son duo have the hang of it now."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
