Inside the Rumors</h1></header><section class=post-content><p class="sc-dksuAk kpjVcu">Ever since Zendaya hit the "unfollow" button on everyone, even her boyfriend Tom Holland, fans have speculated that she's rocking single status.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:image/webp;base64><p>From the moment <a href=#>Tom Holland</a> and <a href=#>Zendaya</a> swung into the Hollywood scene, they've become a power couple that would make even Peter Parker and MJ green with envy! Fans have dishing out the love, and resisting the urge to catch the fuzzy-wuzzy feelings while witnessing their <a href=#>cute relationship</a> is practically impossible.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>But hold onto your web-shooters! In early January 2024, Zendaya hit the reset button and unfollowed everyone she'd been following on <a href=#>Instagram</a>, from friends to co-workers, and yes, even her <a href=#>Spider-Man</a> beau.</p><p>Cue the online rumor mill going into hyperdrive — are our beloved A-list sweethearts swinging solo now, or is this just another web of speculation? Here's everything we know so far about their current relationship status.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, did Tom Holland and Zendaya break up?</h2><p>Thankfully, it seems there's no cause for alarm! We can all sleep soundly knowing that #TomDaya is still together and going strong. Plus, let's not forget that the Euphoria actress's unfollow spree wasn't solely aimed at Tom; others found themselves caught in the crossfire. So, breathe easy because this superhero love story is still swinging high.</p><p>While she didn't offer an explanation for the social media cleanse, Zendaya's most recent Instagram post on Monday, Jan. 1, 2024, featured a poster from her upcoming romantic sports film, <a href=#>Challengers</a>.</p><p>"Challengers April 26th," she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> in the caption. "Wishing you all the most beautiful new year."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Tom and Zendaya have been candid about their social media habits.</h2><p>Although it's not uncommon for celebrities to unfollow the accounts they previously followed, Zendaya has been very open about her social media struggles. In 2021, the Emmy-winning actress told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, "Being on (social media) would kind of make me anxious, or I would start to overthink a little too much."</p><p>Zendaya also offered solid advice for those facing similar challenges: "Take the time that you need and don't compare yourself to anyone else."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>As for Tom, the Uncharted actor still follows Zendaya — but he rarely posts on his Instagram account. In August 2022, he announced a social media break, citing feeling "overwhelmed."</p><p>"I find Instagram and Twitter to be overstimulating, to be overwhelming," the British actor explained in a social media video at the time. "I get caught up, and I spiral when I read things about me online, and ultimately, it's very detrimental to my mental state. So, I decided to take a step back and delete the app."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Tom has since returned to Instagram, but he mainly uses his page to promote his upcoming projects and his Brothers Trust nonprofit. Of his decision to remove the Instagram app from his phone, Tom told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Weekly</a> in July 2023, "I just felt like I was so addicted to this kind of false version of my life that it was just taking over."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Tom recalled that even while on set, he found himself scrolling mindlessly on social media during his breaks: "It was becoming a problem," he said. "I was just obsessed with it. And I was obsessed to find out what people were saying."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Tom has said Zendaya is very good for him.</h2><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GQ</a> from November of 2021, Tom discussed his relationship with Zendaya and how it had shifted his outlook on life in the public eye.</p><p>"Having her in my life was so instrumental to my sanity," the Devil All the Time star told the outlet. "She is so good at being the role model for young guys and girls. When anyone comes up, like, 'Can I have a picture?’ it’s never a bad time. Whereas my initial reaction was, 'Why are you talking to me? Leave me alone.'"</p><p>Tom also added that Zendaya taught him how much work it can be to be famous. Being a role model isn't always easy, and Zendaya helped him to put on a public face that is different from who he really is. That's a lesson they'll both need to take to heart if they continue dating into the future.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbaledOopGagn6G5orrDZpinnF2vsq%2BwwLKYZpqimq6sedSp</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bianka-bella-bryant.html><span>←</span><span>Bianka Bella Bryant - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Facts</span></a>
