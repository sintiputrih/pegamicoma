As of early 2017, based on authoritative sources it is reported to be over $10 million, acquired from his years as a professional poker player which began in the late 1970s.</p><h3>Mike Sexton Net Worth $10 million</h3><p>Born in Shelby, Indiana, Sexton was on a full scholarship as a gymnast at The Ohio University. From taking up a business degree, he shifted to public relations, but during his college years, he was already playing poker and even joked about majoring in it. Aside from poker, he was also already playing contract bridge and even taught some classes in North Carolina.</p><p>Right after college, Sexton joined the US Army as a paratrooper in 1970 but was never deployed abroad. To make his time worthwhile in the army, even teaching some of his comrades ballroom dancing. It was also during his two-year stint in the army that one of his students introduced to him the idea of being a salesman, which he apparently continued with for some time.</p><p>However, in 1977 Sexton decided to shift to playing poker because being a salesman didn’t help his income very much. Despite having a few successes in playing poker, he had a hard time making it big because he was also coaching Little League baseball at the same time.</p><p>After years of juggling poker and baseball, in 1985 Sexton decided to focus on playing poker full time, and so moved to Nevada and became a professional player. The first years were a strong learning experience, but in 1989 he won his first World Series of Poker bracelet. His victories in his early years as a poker player all helped raise his net worth considerably.</p><p>Aside from playing poker, he also became known for promoting various events and tournaments. He also became a prominent commentator on the World Poker Tour, and a spokesperson for PartyPoker.com. His various gigs other than as a player have also helped in raising his income.</p><p>Sexton has also written a couple of books, sharing his knowledge of poker. In 2005, he wrote “Shuffle Up and Deal: The Ultimate No Limit Texas Hold ’em Guide” and “Life’s a Gamble” in 2016, the sales of which also helped in his wealth.</p><p>Today, Sexton is still a prominent face in the poker world. He won the annual World Series Poker Tournament of Champions in 2006 where he took home the grand prize of $1,000,000. He was also selected to be part of the Poker Hall of Fame in 2009. That same year, he created PokerGives.org along with Jan Fisher, Linda Johnson, and Lisa Tenner. The non-profit organization helps poker players to have an easier way of donating to charity.</p><p>In terms of his personal life, Sexton is married to Karen Sexton.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<h3 class=toggle-head>Art Department <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=art_department readability=43><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>Sully</td><td>2016</td><td>property master</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Colony</td><td>2016</td><td>TV Series property master - 1 episode</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Kevin from Work</td><td>2015</td><td>TV Series property master - 1 episode</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Straight Outta Compton</td><td>2015</td><td>property master</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>American Sniper</td><td>2014</td><td>property master</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Bosch</td><td>2014</td><td>TV Series property master - 1 episode</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Runner Runner</td><td>2013</td><td>property master - as Mike Sexton</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Argo</td><td>2012</td><td>property master - as Mike Sexton</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Gone</td><td>2012/I</td><td>property master</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>J.
