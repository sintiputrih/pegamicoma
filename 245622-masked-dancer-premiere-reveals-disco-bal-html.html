Of course, dancing is not what many would associate Ice-T with.</p><p class=fh>However, he explained that he always viewed himself as a dancer. The rapper <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://twitter.com/MaskedDancerFOX/status/1343378713665220608>explained</a>: "Honestly, back in the day, I danced. So I can dance… but not, more of my dancing is in my mind."</p><p class=fh>While the rapper's selection seemed like a fun one, some fans were not pleased. Many expressed their displeasure at the selection on Twitter, with someone claiming that he always knew the rapper <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://twitter.com/nightfury558/status/1343383612700372993>was the Disco Ball</a>.</p><p class=fh>Another problem seemed to have been Ice-T's performance. One Twitter user claimed that it was <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://twitter.com/guaco_leaks/status/1343406724506677248>a total rip off</a>, while another added that the rapper <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://twitter.com/terencej_cole/status/1343378996415762434>had been too slow</a>.</p><h3 class=kh><strong class=dh>It appeared that the rapper's concern with not falling affected his dance routine.</strong></h3><p class=fh>Ice-T's performance marked the first episode of "The Masked Dancer," itself a spinoff of the wildly popular show "The Masked Singer." Sadly, it was not quite enough to keep him in the show as <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://ew.com/tv/recaps/masked-dancer-season-1-episode-1-premiere/>he was ultimately unmasked</a>.</p><p class=fh>Speaking to news sources, the rapper explained that he enjoyed his time on the show. However, he also blamed his costume on his performance. In part, he <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://ew.com/tv/the-masked-dancer-disco-ball-ice-t-interview/>said</a>:</p><p class=fh>"Once you put that 20-pound head on[...] You're just concerned with not falling…I threw all the choreography out the window."</p><p class=fh><a class="Ed a" href=#>Ice-T</a> added that he did not want to "bust his <i class=eh>[</i>expletive<i class=eh>]</i>" on TV like that. It appeared that the rapper's concern with not falling affected his dance routine.</p><p class=fh>All in all, it appears that "The Masked Dancer" is off to a great start. Viewers are already hooked, and there will be more revelations to come. Fans have already <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.bustle.com/entertainment/masked-dancer-season-one-costumes-theories-judges-spoilers>begun sharing theories</a> as to who the characters would be.</p><p class=fh>Names like Grammy-winning singer Taylor Swift, Olympic gold medalist Simone Biles, and Emmy-winning actress Zendaya have already been thrown into the mix. With more weeks to go before the final, the revelations are sure to be an incredible lineup of people.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtrbm5iZ3qurdKknJ1llJa7pLHRZqernZ2esrOxjKucr52RocBusMismqhlkpa5b7TTpqM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tiffany-coyne-bio-wiki-age-family-boyfriend-movies-tv-shows-and-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Tiffany Coyne Bio, Wiki, Age, Family, Boyfriend, Movies, TV Shows and Net Worth</span></a>
