The Country Comfort star, for his part, was married to <a href=#><strong>Brandi Glanville</strong></a>. Rimes split with Sheremet shortly after and the Take Two actor filed for divorce from Glanville in August 2009.</p><p>Rimes and Cibrian got married less than two years later in April 2011. The twosome <a href=#>were involved in a feud with Glanville</a>, who later joined the <a href=#>Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</a>, over the years, until <a href=#>they publicly discussed their issues</a> in April 2018. Since then, the trio has worked on coparenting Cibrian and Glanville‚Äôs sons, Mason and Jake, together.</p><p>Meanwhile, Rimes and Cibrian have continued to share glimpses at their marriage on social media.</p><p>‚ÄúHappy Anniversary, my LovE! I am so blessed to be able to share this life with you and the boys. Thank you for being the safe place to finally rest my heart. Without you, my journey of expansion and self discovery, my homecoming back to my own wholeness may have never happened,‚Äù Rimes captioned her letter to her husband via Instagram on their tenth anniversary in April 2021.</p><p>She added: ‚ÄúThank you for holding a space for ALL of me to be expressed and seen, even if I, myself am still sometimes waking up to all of who you know me to be. You are the biggest cheerleader in my life, my greatest admirer and I yours. Thank you for loving me! I look forward to our continued journey, one of adventure, growth and lots and lots of joy! I LovE you! üíï‚Äù</p><p>The actor has also previously spoken about <a href=#>the love he has for his wife</a> during an interview with Us.</p><p>‚ÄúOne of my favorite things to do is watch my wife perform live. I don‚Äôt really have a favorite song. I love all the songs she sings. She could sing the phone book and I‚Äôd love it,‚Äù the actor said in July 2018.</p><p>The one thing the duo don‚Äôt see in their future though<a href=#> is another attempt at a reality TV show</a>. Rimes and Cibrian had a short-lived show called LeAnn & Eddie that aired for one season on VH1 in 2014.</p><p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so,‚Äù Cibrian said on the ‚ÄúWatch With Us‚Äù podcast in March 2021. ‚ÄúI mean, back when we decided to do something like that, you know, we wanted to do something a little tongue-in-cheek ‚Äî kind of poke fun at some things. That was fine for that time, but I don‚Äôt see it happening again with us. Although, in other genres, maybe.‚Äù</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Cibrian added, ‚ÄúMaybe there‚Äôs, like, something for HGTV or something in those lines, you know? Maybe go helping other people do certain things or stuff like that. Maybe come up with some ideas and produce some stuff.‚Äù</p><p>Scroll on for a timeline of their romance:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkuaatzadkmqaUYrKlsMieqmabn6PBs7vVnqmsoZGheq271Z5ka2hhZX92hI4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jessica-batten-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-41784-html.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Jessica Batten Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
