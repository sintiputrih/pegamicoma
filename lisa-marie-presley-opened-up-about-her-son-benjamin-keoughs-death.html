<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Lisa Marie Presley Opened Up About Her Son Benjamin Keoughs Death</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Lisa Marie Presley</strong>, an American singer, said that she would lose her son Benjamin Keough in 2020. On National Grief Awareness Day, the 54-year-old actress sent a touching letter about the loss of her son, whom she shares with her ex-husband Danny Keough.&nbsp;Lisa has four children: Benjamin and Riley with Danny Keough, and twin daughters Harper and Finley with Michael Lockwood.</p><p>Lisa Marie Presley wrote an editorial for People Magazine on her sadness at the loss of her 27-year-old son, discussing the “uncomfortable issue” with the goal of assisting anybody who is suffering.</p><p>“Whether we like it or not, death and grief are inevitable parts of existence.” There is a lot to study and grasp about this topic, but here’s what I know so far: One is that sorrow does not end or go away a year or years after a loss. Regardless of what some individuals or our society would have us think, grief is something you will have to live with for the rest of your life. You don’t get over it; you don’t go on.”</p><p>She claimed that sorrow is “very lonely,” and that at a certain time, others, even “family,” want the victim to move on from their loss. She went on:</p><p>“If you’re really fortunate, just a few (friends and family members) will stay in touch with you beyond the first month or two.”</p><p>Lisa Marie Presley also claimed that when a loved one dies from unnatural causes, society tends to “stigmatize” and “judge” the person who bears the loss. Lisa Marie Presley claimed that she hates herself every day for her child’s death, but that her kids keep her going.</p><p>She went on to say:</p><p>“It’s a true decision to keep going, one that I have to make every single day and one that is, to put it mildly, continuously tough… But I keep going because I love my daughters. I keep going because my son made it obvious in his dying moments that taking care of his younger sisters and watching out for them were at the top of his priorities. He cherished them, and they adored him. His death absolutely exploded and devastated mine and my three children’s lives as we knew them. We are immersed in it every single day.”</p><h2>Lisa Marie Presley wishes to keep her twin girls away from the public eye.</h2><p>Lisa Marie Presley is the only child of Elvis Presley and Priscilla Presley, the King of Rock & Roll. The 54-year-old has followed in her father’s footsteps and is a well-known singer and composer.&nbsp;The Lights Out singer has four children, two of whom she shares with two of her ex-husbands. In 1988, she married actor Danny Keough for the first time. Riley Keough and Benjamin Keough were their two children.</p><p>Riley Keough is Marie Presley and Keough’s oldest daughter, born on May 29, 1989. She has made a name for herself as an actor and model. She has appeared in various films and television programs, including Magic Mike, Mad Max: Fury Road, The Girlfriend Experience, We Don’t Belong Here, Logan Lucky, Under the Silver Lake, Riverdale, Earthquake Bird, The Devil All the Time, The Terminal List, and others, according to her IMDb biography.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Lisa-Marie-Presley-1.jpg alt="Lisa Marie Presley" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Riley told The List that her parents had quite different upbringings, and she was fully aware of this.</p><p>She stated:</p><p>“I had a pretty affluent upbringing with my mum.” But my father was not like that. And I believe that having been on both sides has been beneficial. Mattresses were on the floor of my father’s apartments. He lived in trailer parks and huts.”</p><p>In October 1992, Lisa Marie Presley and Danny had their second child, Benjamin. According to Closer Weekly, he has a strong similarity to Elvis Presley, which the So Lovely singer confirmed.</p><p>While speaking with CMT, she stated:</p><p>“He was the silent storm behind the stage at the Opry.” When he was over there, everyone turned around and stared. Everyone wanted to take a picture with him since he is so strange. When I look at him, I am overwhelmed.”</p><p>Unfortunately, Benjamin committed suicide on July 12, 2020, leaving Marie Presley and her kids distraught. After six years of marriage, she and Keough divorced in 1994.&nbsp;Lisa Marie Presley was previously married to Michael Jackson and Nicholas Cage for a short time but had no children with either of them. She married musician Michael Lockwood for the fourth time in 2006, but they divorced in 2021. Harper Lockwood and Finley Lockwood are their twin daughters.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Lisa-Marie-Presley-2.jpg alt="Lisa Marie Presley" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Lisa Marie Presley keeps her 13-year-old daughters out of the spotlight, although they do appear on her Instagram account from time to time.&nbsp;Priscilla, the twins’ grandmother, told Us Weekly that they are exceptionally intelligent and technologically aware. She stated:</p><p>“I mean, they’re better at handling the phone than I am.” They already know how to Google and draw objects and characters, and oh my my. They’re simply small girls having fun and experiencing life.”</p><p>She also said that the girls were enrolled in ballet and opera training.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGijoquRYrqivsieZKmqlai5psWMqKeeppWZera8jJqZqK2kYrWmvoyspqdlkpq7q63MoqVmo5Wkwqi00mabnpmknXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./heidi-montag-denies-she-spencer-pratt-are-pregnant-with-baby-no-2.html><span>←</span><span>Heidi Montag Denies She, Spencer Pratt Are Pregnant With Baby No. 2</span></a>
