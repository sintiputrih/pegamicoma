James and Alex teamed up together for a short time in the 1960s as The Fabulous Corsayers with three friends, according to <a href=#>Rolling Stone</a>. The Taylor brothers shared vocal duties in the group. "We <a href=#>played mostly proms</a> and a few fraternity gigs 'cause we lived in a university town," James Taylor told Rolling Stone. "And we were cheap."</p><p dir=ltr>Unlike his more famous brother, Alex Taylor only put out a few albums in his lifetime. Taylor had a bluesy vocal style that helped him earn a contract with the Macon, Georgia-based label Capricorn (via Music Museum of New England). He befriended fellow southern rock act the Allman Brothers Band and sometimes opened for the group. Taylor put out his first record, "With Friends and Neighbors," in 1971, which featured songs by his brother James and <a href=#>Gregg Allman of the Allman Brothers Band</a> (via <a href=#>Discogs</a>). He followed up that release with 1972's "Dinnertime," on which he offered listeners his take on songs by Randy Newman and Bob Dylan. His musical output tapered off after that, and his last commercially released record, "Voodoo in Me," was released in 1989 (via <a href=#>All Music</a>).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCAkG5pam9fqbWmedOrmKChk2Kxpq3ToWSonl2frq6x0marmrGcpL%2B0ec6lm56qXZe%2FsMDHnqlo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./did-lebron-james-transplant-his-hair.html><span>←</span><span>Did Lebron James Transplant His Hair?
