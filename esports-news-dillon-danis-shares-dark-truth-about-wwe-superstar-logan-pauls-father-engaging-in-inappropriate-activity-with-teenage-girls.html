<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Dillon Danis shares DARK TRUTH about Logan Pauls Father engaging in inappropriate activity</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>The continuing online battle between Dillon Danis and Logan Paul is still going on strong. Danis will take on Logan Paul in his first exhibition match in October of this year. Since the announcement, Danis has also consistently criticized and denigrated Logan online. The MMA fighter has been doing this by repeatedly criticizing Logan’s fiancée,&nbsp;Nina Adgal,&nbsp;on his official <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a> account. However, this time, Danis has revealed that Logan Paul’s father, Greg Paul, used to engage in inappropriate activity with teenage girls!</p><p>Since the reveal of the match between Logan Paul and Dillon Danis, the internet hadn’t had a single moment of rest. Furthermore, many popular streamers and internet personalities joined the fray. Recently, Danis was in a stream with Adin Ross and taught his a few moves. Danis even showed an alleged wedding-ruining picture of Nina to not just Adin Ross but also <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Andrew Tate</a>!</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Furthermore, after constant comments and insults, Nina Agdal even <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sued</a> Danis for a hefty amount of Lawsuit. However, this time, Danis has directly targeted Logan Paul’s father, Greg Paul. And the allegations have shocked fans!</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“You’re literally Logan Paul’s c*mrag,” Dillon Danis BRUTALLY trolls and exchange words with Logan Paul’s good friend Mike Majlak on&nbsp;X</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-dillon-danis-reveals-logan-paul-s-father-engaging-in-inappropriate-activities-with-teenage-girls>Dillon Danis reveals Logan Paul’s father engaging in inappropriate activities with teenage girls</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/l-gregory-allan-paul-r-835515114-1-1200x800.jpg><p>For a while, the life of the Paul Family hasn’t been that great. The major reason for that isn’t just the inner strife within the family, but also Dillon Danis. Since the fight announcement of Danis vs Logan, along with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">KSI</a>‘s prime card match, the MMA fighter has been attacking Logan constantly. And this time, Danis has not sparred even Logan Paul’s father, Greg Paul.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Greg Paul has a significant fan base on the internet. However, that’s nowhere near helping him out of controversies. A hacker&nbsp;gang known as Digital Gangsters allegedly hacked Greg in 2018. Greg is said to have been caught in s*x films with minor females, according to this group. The group said in an interview, “We wanted to see how far we could go with the hack; we obviously got pretty far. We don’t really like him; we don’t like the Pauls.”</p><p>Greg although denied the claims, saying,</p><p>“The haters and the hackers spreading rumors that I’ve been with underage women is a bunch of bull; it’s never happened, and it’s 100 percent not true. There’s no supporting evidence, and there never will be, and the reason there never will be is because it never happened. If anybody even tries to say anything to that effect in any way, shape, or form they’re just doing it for views just like they are right now. The other things for you haters, how bad does your life suck? How bad does your life suck? You wake up and you want to throw shade and hate on people you’ve never met, who’ve never done anything to you.“</p><p>Despite all the false claims raised and not being found guilty, many streamers and content creators have backed the info. Especially, Keemstar has said the info is correct. This entire drama has been going really far with no signs of stopping anytime soon. Fans see many streamer dramas; however, this one has been spammed for days. Both Dillon Danis and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Logan Paul</a> are now out for blood, as Danis has now directly involved Logan Paul’s father!</p><p>In case you missed it:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiemafAtb%2FPqKmtsl6YvK57xKynqKqkqHqvsdasZJ2hnKG8r3nDmqWiq12otaK%2BxKxknZmioHq1vtStn2aZkqTCtXnWsJxmq6WlsrO%2F05qpZqSfnK6vec%2BarKWrXZuutbTEq2SeppeWtKq6xmagp2WZo66xvNGop6uhkamybq3CraCvoaSueri106FkrZ2Vo66osYygoKuko2Q%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./courtney-burrell-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Courtney Burrell Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
