Given he was so young at the time of his death, rumors started circulating on what exactly happened. Pretty early after it was confirmed he had passed away, initial reports speculated that he had died by suicide after suffering from depression.</p><p>Fero's death was announced by his family through Fero's official Twitter account. The statement confirmed that he did not die by suicide, despite reports to the contrary, and assured his fans that he was not suffering from depression.&nbsp;</p><p>"We would like to state that he did not take his own life, and he was not battling depression," the tweet read. "We appreciate everyone's love and support. We would also appreciate privacy at this time."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>This is Maurice's, aka F3ro, family.

"I understand you guys are all in shock but go through F3ro's tweets, he was open with him battling depression," one person tweeted. "My condolences and prayers go out to you guys and may he rest in peace."</p><p>Another person <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> a photo of an alleged private message conversation between Fero and a fan where they were talking about feeling "sadness" and "anxiety." Others speculated that he had passed away due to an overdose.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Thank you for positively impacting the lives of so many people.
