After all these years, Aly & AJ finally confirmed that one of their songs is about <a href=#><strong>Joe Jonas</strong></a> — but it’s not the one that fans suspect.</p><p>YouTuber <strong>Elle Mills</strong> went viral earlier this month when she <a href=#>tweeted</a> throwback photos of <strong>AJ Michalka</strong> and the Jonas Brothers member, reminding fans that the singers were briefly a couple during their Disney heydays. “Ok so you’re telling me that i went 13 years not knowing that one of the greatest songs ever written was about joE JONAS THIS ENTIRE TIME,” she wrote, referencing “Potential Breakup Song.”</p><p>The tweet quickly spread online — and even became the subject of a mini <a href=#>BuzzFeed</a> investigation — before making its way to Aly & AJ, who set the record straight on Thursday, April 9.</p><p>“Flattery not Potential,” the pop duo <a href=#>tweeted</a>, confirming that the lesser-known cut from their 2007 album, Insomniatic, was inspired by Jonas and not the lead single.</p><p>Fans speculated for years that “Potential Breakup Song” was about the DNCE member, 30, due to the opening lyrics, “It took too long for you to call back / And normally I would just forget that / Except for the fact it was my birthday / My stupid birthday.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The lyrics seemed to be a jab at Jonas because AJ, 28, once confirmed that she mailed him a piece of her birthday cake as a teenager to make him feel bad. “That’s a true story, oh the joys of being young and in love,” she wrote during a <a href=#>Reddit</a> Ask Me Anything in March 2018.</p><p>Of course, this isn’t the first time that Jonas has inspired a breakup anthem. <a href=#><strong>Taylor Swift</strong></a> is rumored to have written “Forever & Always” about him, and <a href=#><strong>Demi Lovato</strong></a> confirmed he was her muse for “Gonna Get Caught.”</p><p>After high-profile romances with AJ, Swift, now 30, Lovato, now 27, <a href=#><strong>Camilla Belle</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Ashley Greene</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Gigi Hadid</strong></a>, the Camp Rock actor found The One in 2016 when he met <strong>Sophie Turner</strong>. He and the Game of Thrones alum, 24, <a href=#>married in May 2019</a> and are now <a href=#>expecting their first child together</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJilsV2Wt26yy5qrrZ2irnqqv4yamaitpGK3sLGMo6anmaNiu7DAjKmmrZ2eqbaiuIybqZ6Zm6q9br%2FOp55o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./itati-lopezs-boyfriend-list.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Itati Lopez Dating Itati Lopez's Boyfriend &amp;amp; Exes</span></a>
