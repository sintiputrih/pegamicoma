To achieve this ending: there are a few dialog choices required to reach this ending. During the “A Little Test” scene, the player must answer at least one question correctly to continue. Very specific to “The Photography Crew” scene, when Beidou asks where the Traveler would like to take her photo, select the option: “I heard there’s a fishing village near Wangshu Inn.” to stay on the path for this ending. After this, during the “A Smattering of Memories” scene, when Beidou asks the Traveler to strike a pose, select either “However you prefer” or “Perhaps you can strike an epic pose” in order to achieve the ending.</p><p><strong>Ending B – Flirtatious</strong></p><img title="Genshin Impact Beidou Hangout: All Answers and Endings" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Genshin-Beidou-Hangou-Ending-B.jpg alt=Genshin-Beidou-Hangou-Ending-B width=1280 height=640 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Storyline Path:&nbsp; A Little Test > The Photography Crew >The Nameless Fishing Village > The Long Years > A Smattering of Memories</p><p>During this dialog path: The Traveler attempts to take a flirty photo of Beidou without her permission, which ends with a humorous reaction from her. To achieve the ending, follow the same dialog choices above. During the “A Smattering of Memories” scene when Beidou asks the Traveler to strike a pose, select the “Maybe go for something a little… flirtatious?” option to achieve this ending.</p><p>A Little Test – Cheat Sheet</p><p>During this dialog path, Beidou will be giving the Traveler a short test on how to conduct oneself as a pirate on the high seas. While these answers can be learned from talking to the various crew members, this guide will list out all the correct answers for convenience.</p><ul><li>“What’s the single biggest danger facing crew members”? – Answer: Understanding Danger</li><li>“The supplementary chart has lots of lines in various colors for added reference. What is the purpose of these lines?” Answer: To mark distances</li><li>“How can we reliably predict waterspouts, so we can avoid them?” – Answer: The presence of dark clouds and strong winds in opposite directions, plus white vortices in the clouds.</li></ul><p><strong>Ending C – Once Everything is Over</strong></p><img title="Genshin Impact Beidou Hangout: All Answers and Endings" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Genshin-Beidou-Hangout-Ending-C.jpg alt=Genshin-Beidou-Hangout-Ending-C width=1280 height=640 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Storyline Path:&nbsp; Sailor Training > Training: The Shield of the Crux > A Little Test > The Crux of Our Duties > A Strange Transaction</p><p>During this dialog path, the Traveler will learn more about how Beidou and her crew conduct business in order to maintain living expenses.
