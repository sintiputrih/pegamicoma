The chimpanzees – which suffer from the hair-loss condition alopecia – brutally beat each other up, prompting some to believe they could take over the world.
Footage shows the primates running rampant inside an enclosure as they gang up and begin ruthlessly beating each other.
One animal in particular caught viewers attention because of his lack of hair and muscular build and superfast movements."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
