Vikas Oberoi entered the billionaires’ club thanks to the real estate developer Oberoi Construction, which he inherited from his father. What his father set up back in 1985 as a small family business today is a company with a portfolio of 32 completed projects covering around 4.979 million square feet of saleable area spread across the city of Mumbai. The company has been listed at Bombay Stock Exchange ever since 2010, and most recently, Oberoi had to reduce his stake in the firm from 79% to 75%, all in order to comply with stock market rules. With headquarters in Mumbai, Maharashtra, the real estate developer continues to grow building office space, retail, social infrastructure, hospitality and residential properties. Married and a father of two, he claims he’s taking guitar lessons only to get his two sons interested in music.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK6ZoK60ec6bnKunmah6r7HTZq6oqqSdeqO1zqCpmqiYrnqnrcKtZJyZopqys3nAsJirnKNirq%2BwjKWgn51dqMGwvtho</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bloodletting.html><span>←</span><span>The Gross History Of Bloodletting And Medicine By Leeches</span></a>
