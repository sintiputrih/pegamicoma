When Ashby agreed to reprise his role, his one request of executive producer/headwriter Josh Griffith was, “Hey, man, let’s write him bad,” the actor told <a href=# rel=noopener>Soap Opera Digest</a>. In character, he added, “I’m not looking for a redemptive story here. I’m not looking to turn over a new leaf. I’ve got a few scores to settle and business to take care of.”</p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/JPI_Episode12630_0002033878.jpeg alt='Linden Ashby, Reylynn Caster"The Young and the Restless" Set CBS television CityLos Angeles04/25/23© Howard Wise/jpistudios.com310-657-9661Episode # 12630U.S. Airdate 06/01/23' width=1024 height=597 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=wp-caption-text>Kidnapping victim Faith was just a means to an end for Cameron.</p><p id=image-credit-attachment-675337 class=soaps-image-credit>Credit: Howard Wise/JPI</p><p>Though Cameron’s only actual casualty was poor Faith’s cat, Borgnine, the repercussions of his reign of terror are sure to be felt for months to come as Sharon and former husband Nick deal with the aftershocks of his vendetta. Ironically, despite Cameron’s treatment of Sharon, his portrayer has said that he really loves her. “It’s probably not the healthiest relationship in the world, but his love is genuine.”</p><p>Though at the close of Friday’s episode, Cameron certainly appeared to be really, most sincerely dead, will he stay that way? Maybe… maybe not. By the time his return engagement was over, Ashby said that he was kinda sorry it was finished. And hey, he got to work at least a little bit with his real-life wife, Susan Walters (Diane) — always a plus!
