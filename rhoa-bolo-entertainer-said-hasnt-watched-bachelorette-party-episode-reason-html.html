In the summer of 2020, Bravo star Kandi Burruss approached Bolo about dancing at Bailey’s bachelorette party. The 53-year-old model was preparing to marry her <a href=#>then-fiance, Mike Hill</a>, in Oct. 2020.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-4_62>Due to COVID-19, the RHOA cast traveled to the Isle of Palms in South Carolina for the girls’ trip. During a Feb. 2021 episode of season 13, <a href=#>Bolo joined the women</a> at their rented house to perform for them. The dancer stripped down in front of the cast, including Bailey, Burruss, Porsha Williams, Drew Sidora, Tanya Sam, Kenya Moore, and several others.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_54>Following the party, rumors swirled that Williams and Sam engaged in a threesome with Bolo. While Williams laughed off the reports, Sam released an <a href=#>Instagram</a> statement denying the allegations <a href=#>before exiting RHOA</a>. Although some cast members didn’t fully enjoy the event, Bailey personally thanked Bolo for the bachelorette party on Watch What Happens Live.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_83>“Hi, Bolo,” Bailey said during the video chat. “I hope all is well with you, and I just wanted to say thank you so much for helping Kandi [Burruss] make my bachelorette party probably the biggest — no pun intended — and most epic bachelorette party of all time. Like, I literally have friends calling me who are married saying, ‘I want to get divorced so I can get married again and have a bachelorette party with Bolo and have Kandi throw it.'”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-why-bolo-the-entertainer-didn-t-watch-his-rhoa-episode>Why Bolo the Entertainer didn’t watch his ‘RHOA’ episode</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-7_54>During his appearance on WWHL, Bolo (whose real name is Michael Bolwaire) shared why he didn’t watch his RHOA debut. He told Cohen, Bailey, and fellow guest, <a href=#>Miss Lawrence</a>, that he only read fan’s comments. Bolo also admitted that he’s focused on other projects and isn’t interested in looking back at the bachelorette party.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_41>“I’ve got other stuff to be taking care of,” the 31-year-old dancer said. “I hear about it afterwards. As far as watching the show, no, I didn’t watch it. I was there. What the hell I need to watch it for?”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bolo-the-entertainer-s-net-worth>Bolo the Entertainer’s net worth</h2><p id=par-9_51>According to <a href=#>Primal Information</a>, Bolo the Entertainer’s net worth is $1 million. In addition to working on new projects, the model said his OnlyFans page increased in revenue after RHOA. While speaking to Cohen, the host said <a href=#>Bolo’s page</a> on the subscription service must be “booming” since his RHOA episode aired.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-10_19>“It’s doing pretty good,” he said.“It’s doing a lot better than it was about two to three weeks ago.”&nbsp;<br></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-4><p></p></figure><p id=par-11_23>RHOA isn’t Bolo the Entertainer’s first reality show.
