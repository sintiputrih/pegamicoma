She knows how much that would hurt."</p><p>The source added: "Selena is kind and the last thing she would ever want would be to be part of trouble in their relationship. She has moved on.”</p><p>The pair were first linked publicly in 2011 and <a href=#>dated on and off</a> until their final split in 2018 - just before Justin popped the question to Hailey, 23, after three months of dating.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/07/NINTCHDBPICT000584564537.jpg><p>'Jelena' fans are also convinced Justin has been keeping tabs on his ex, after her HBO Max cooking show, Selena & Chef, was spotted on the browsing list of her ex's TV in the background of an Instagram Story.</p><p>Hailey, who reconnected with Bieber through the <a href=#>Hillsong Church</a>, said she found God again later on in life, telling Elle Magazine: "As I got older, it got harder to follow church and the Bible because it felt very adult. I don’t want to sound wrong, but it was boring.</p><p>"I didn’t care about it anymore, until I found a church I felt was geared toward young people, And for me, that was the Hillsong Church in New York City.</p><p>“Then I developed my own relationship to church and my own relationship with God, separate from being raised that way by my parents. That’s been a cool journey for me.”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>The Hillsong church, which has a large celebrity following, is a global organization, with locations across the globe and has an estimated weekly attendance of 100,000 people.</p><p>The Sun has contacted Justin and Selena's reps for comment.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Justin Bieber wishes he'd saved himself for marriage because ‘sex can be kind of confusing'</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hpY2yBeoSXaKGuq6Seu26uyJ6ZnqpdqLKtsc2aZKCnnZrHbrTAoqOesV2Xrq2w1qKlZqqVobaotc6nZKiao5rAtLHDaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./florida-georgia-line.html><span>←</span><span>Florida Georgia Line Celebrity Profile Hollywood Life</span></a>
