Even his law firm’s slogan is “Hit by a truck or a car – CALL JR!” which sounds quite catchy.</p><p dir=ltr>Other than that, he is also the CEO of his own company called Rags 2 Riches Logistics where the company provides logistics services for delivering cars and other services.</p><p dir=ltr>To talk about his personal life, Robinson comes from New Orleans and was raised by a single mother addicted to drugs.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=jeremy-robinson-attorney-net-worth></span>Jeremy Robinson Attorney Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jeremy Robinson net worth as an attorney is $ 1 million. Jeremy hails from New Orleans and now resides in Atlanta.</p><p>His earnings come from the law firm called The JR Law Group, which he and his other silent partners established.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=the-jr-law-group></span>The JR Law Group<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The&nbsp;JR Law Group&nbsp;was established in Atlanta, Georgia, on October 9, 2020. The law firm mainly practices personal injury and criminal defense.</p><p>Besides Robinson, Jasmine Jones works as an Office Manager and Senior Paralegal for the group.</p><p>The law firm has only been established for around two and a half years. So, their number of clients is less compared to well-established firms.</p><p>But the clients they have accepted have all received their due compensation. However, most of the cases received are for motor vehicle accidents or underinsured motorist insurance.</p><figure></figure><p>Other cases, such as fender-bender and minor injury cases, have also been handled by the firm.</p><p>A well-established law firm with few lawyers has a net worth of more than $5 million. Since the&nbsp;JR Law Group&nbsp;has only recently been established and they don’t have other attorneys, the company should be worth $500k.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=rag-2-riches-logistics></span>Rag 2 Riches Logistics<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Similar to his law firm, Jeremy’s&nbsp;Rag 2 Riches Logistics&nbsp;is also new in the market.</p><p>The company was established on 12 May 2021, which has not even been 2 years’ time for now.</p><p>While Jeremy is the CEO of the logistics company, Joshua Smith is the silent partner and the organizer of the firm.</p><p>The company mainly deals with package delivery systems. Other than that, both Robinson and Joshua are providing lessons on logistics systems so that they can create more Delivery Service Partners.</p><figure></figure><p>According to their bio, the company is established for “Turning small capital into a million dollar transportation business. Follow us to learn how to change your financial demographics.”</p><p>Though the company has its&nbsp;Instagram&nbsp;profile, there have not been any new updates or any other information provided.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=jeremys-wealth-compared-to-fiance-tamar-braxton></span>Jeremy’s Wealth Compared To Fiance Tamar Braxton<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jeremy Robinson wealth compared to his finance is a lot less. Tamor Baxton’s net worth before she appeared on Queens Court was $3 million.</p><p>Tamor Baxton&nbsp;is a reputed American singer, reality star and actress. She is also part of founding member of The Baxtons, an R&B singing group formed by her sisters. Through the said group, she started her career in the entertainment industry.</p><p>The actress was born on March 17, 1977, to her father Michael Baxton and her mother Evelyn Baxton in Severn, Maryland.</p><p>She was the youngest of the Baxton siblings. She had the gift of singing from a young age and joined the church choir when she was big enough.</p><figure></figure><p>Later she started her solo journey in singing after the disbandment of her singing group.</p><p>Her first album came in 2000 and reached 127 on Billboard 200. Later she released her second album, Love and War, in 2013, which became an instant hit reaching the second position on Billboard 200.</p><p>She also released other albums such as Winter Loversland, Calling All Lovers, and Bluebird of Happiness.</p><p>After that, she appeared on shows such as Celebrity Big Brother, To Catch a Beautician, and Tamar Braxton: Get Ya Life.</p><p>She was married to Darrell Allamby a music producer, Vincent Herbert a record executive and David Adefeso a financial advisor.</p><p>She stayed in the longest relationship with Vincent Herbert whom she had a son named Logan.</p><p>Tamar along with her husband at that time Vincent had bought a mansion in Calabasas, California, for $10.5 million, which she later tried to sell for more than $15 million.</p><p>But the property had to be sold for $9.25 million taking a loss of $1.25 million.</p><p>So, all her celebrity shows, her record albums, and her property let her a&nbsp;net worth&nbsp;be $3 million.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=tamar-braxton-got-engaged-to-jeremy-robinson-on-queens-court></span>Tamar Braxton Got Engaged To Jeremy Robinson on Queens Court<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In Peacock’s new show Queens Court, we see Tamar being engaged to Jeremy Robinson. Now, the couple is planning for their wedding.</p><p>Attorney Jeremy Robinson was one of the finalists of&nbsp;Peacock’s&nbsp;show Queens Court where he purposed to Tamar Braxton.</p><p>During the proposal, the attorney expressed that he didn’t just want to be a friend of Tamar but a husband. And he stated her loved her and asked for a hand in marriage.</p><figure></figure><p>The 45-year-old accepted the proposal from Jeremy because she felt that he was someone who would understand her rather than look at her flaws. And she found everything in Robinson.</p><p>When she was asked for her hand, she was in tears of happiness and gave ‘Yes’ in her reply. Now, the couple are said to be in preparation for marriage pretty soon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKKVp7KuxYyrppuhnqi8r3nArauoqp6axm66xK1ksKeiqbVufo9ramg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./seagate-go-flex-home-2tb-reviewed.html><span>←</span><span>Bundled Software - Seagate GoFlex Home 2TB Reviewed</span></a>
