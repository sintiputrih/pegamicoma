He was booked on one count of marijuana possession. In addition to a felony drug charge that he's now facing, he's also being written up for having tinted front windows on the vehicle he was driving at the time. This isn't the first time Young Thug has been on the receiving end of drug possession charges. Back in 2015, similar bookings were made by the&nbsp;</span><a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">charges were ultimately dropped</a>&nbsp;after the raid on his home was done illegally by police.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The new&nbsp;TMZ report also states how much he had on him over the weekend. Thugger was supposedly carrying 2.5 oz of the good stuff on him, with the stash being discovered by a routine traffic stop. Police had originally pulled him over for the tinted windows situation, but once the drugs were found, more serious charges were levied against the Southern rapper. The case is still being reviewed by the D.A. and that's why no bail has been set at the time of this writing. To that end, there's no telling how much jail time the emcee could face if the felony charge is pursued by a prosecutor in the months that follow. For now, let's just hope he can get himself out of the joint sooner rather than later.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span class=s1>In spite of all of this, Young Thug is scheduled to perform at this year’s STACKED Rolling Loud Festival in San Francisco.&nbsp;The event, which takes place next month, will see him be joined on stage by&nbsp;<a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Lil Wayne</a>, Schoolboy Q, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Lil Uzi Vert</a>, XXXTENTACION, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Kodak Black</a>, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>21 Savage</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Dave East</a>, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Playboi Carti</a>, and many more.
