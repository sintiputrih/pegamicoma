After all, film franchises like the Twilight, <a href=#>Harry Potter</a>, and Hunger Game series, as well as stand-alone movies like The Fault In Our Stars have enjoyed lots of success at the box office. With that in mind, it makes all of the sense in the world that The CW wanted to get in on that entertainment trend.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When The CW adapted a young adult novel series titled The 100 into a television series of the same name, it is clear that the network had high hopes for the project. Thankfully for everyone involved, The 100 would go on to become a big enough hit that it aired for seven seasons which is an impressive feat for any series. More importantly, The 100 was one of those rare shows that managed to attract a hugely loyal fan base. In fact, now that it has been more than a year since the show's finale aired, a lot of the show’s fans want to know everything they can about <a href=#>what members of The 100’s cast are up to now</a>. For example, there is a lot of curiosity about what has been keeping Lindsey Morgan busy since The 100 ended.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About Shawn Mendes' Role In 'The 100'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-lindsey-morgan-has-been-doing-since-the-100>What Lindsey Morgan Has Been Doing Since The 100</h2><p>For longtime fans of Conan O’Brien, the show Walker, Texas Ranger is most memorable for all of the hilarious segments in which the talk show host played out-of-context clips from the series. Since those comedy bits made some people perceive Walker, Texas Ranger as a series that was thoroughly worthy of mockery and derision, many people have forgotten how successful the show was.</p><p>A Chuck Norris headlined action crime drama that aired for eight seasons, Walker, Texas Ranger was broadcast in over 100 countries around the world. On top of that, since the show’s finale aired, Walker, Texas Ranger has been a syndication mainstay which is all the more impressive since so many fans also bought seasons of the series on DVD. As a result of all the success that Walker, Texas Ranger has enjoyed over the years, The CW opted to reboot the series for modern audiences.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>20 Things About Chuck Norris That Fans Choose To Ignore</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When The CW decided to reboot Walker, Texas Ranger, the powers that be decided to turn to a couple of stars they trusted since they were great in other shows that aired on the network. First off, Jared Padalecki of Supernatural fame was hired to star as Walker’s titular lead character. Additionally, Lindsey Morgan was cast as the show’s second most important character, Walker’s new partner in the Texas Rangers, Micki Ramirez.</p><p>Unfortunately, after starring in the first two seasons of Walker, both of which aired after The 100 came to an end, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lindsey Morgan announced she would be leaving her new show</a>. “After much thoughtful consideration and introspection, I have made the incredibly difficult decision to step away from my role as Micki Ramirez on Walker for personal reasons, and I am eternally grateful to have the support of the producers, CBS Studios and The CW in allowing me to do so. The opportunity to play Micki has truly been a blessing as has working alongside the incredible cast and crew of this terrific series. Please know that I will continue to root for my TV family and wish them all the best.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As of the time of this writing, there is no way to know what Morgan’s motivation to leave Walker’s cast was. Hopefully, whatever is going on works out for Morgan in the end and her career remains on track in the years to come. On the bright side, based on the footage of a speech Morgan gave during her last day on the Walker set, she left on good terms with everyone. It is also worth noting that in addition to starring in Walker, Morgan also headlined a movie titled Skylines that was released after The 100’s finale aired.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Supernatural Prequel: What We Know, And Why Jared Padalecki Was 'Gutted'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=is-lindsey-morgan-in-a-relationship>Is Lindsey Morgan In A Relationship?</h2><p>In the months since The 100 ended, fans of the series have been delighted to see that many of the actors that were most associated with the show have seemingly found happiness in their love lives. In fact, several of The 100’s stars are now in a couple together, including <a href=#>Eliza Taylor And Bob Morley who seem extremely happy together</a>.</p><p>Even though Lindsey Morgan isn’t involved with any of her former The 100 co-stars, she is in a relationship with an actor who appeared in a different show that aired on The CW for years. After all, long before Shaun Sipos met Morgan, he appeared in eight episodes of The Vampire Diaries as Aaron Whitmore.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Thankfully for Lindsey Morgan and Shaun Sipos, they seem extremely happy together from the outside looking in. After all, it seems abundantly clear that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one of the highlights of Morgan's post-The 100 life was announcing her engagement to Sipos</a> on December 28th, 2020. “2020 coming in with that twist ending ♥️ Thank you my love, @shaun_sipos for making me the happiest I’ve ever been, every damn day since I met you... and now for the rest of my life ♥️ no pressure I can’t wait to see what unfolds next for us on our great, big life adventure ♥️”</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>The Truth About Murphy From ‘The 100’s’ Real-Life Relationship With His Co-Star</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipmq6Vo3q1tMRmaGloXaG2r7DSnrBmpZ%2BntKK6jKemsGWnna61eceap6mdnpqxcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./switch-oled-vs-switch-normal-diferencias-cual-es-mejor.html><span>←</span><span>Switch OLED vs. Switch original: cul es la mejor opcin?</span></a>
