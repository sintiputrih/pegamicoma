For example, when some of the other ladies were participating in the #BirkinChallenge on Instagram, Kandi made it clear that luxury purses weren't her thing. She wrote in her Instagram Story (via <a href=#>The Daily Dish</a>), "I don't own a Birkin...Sorry." In an interaction with her friend, she later storied, "Now @kimblackwellpmm is talking about a property challenge. Now you talking my language friend!"</p><p dir=ltr>It seems that Kandi really does prefer to spend her money on her homes. Per&nbsp;<a href=#>The Sun</a>, Kandi owns a $1.7 million mansion in Atlanta that boasts 7 bedrooms and 9.5 bathrooms, not to mention a large music room with a red, crocodile-print grand piano. It's safe to say that Kandi's made a pretty penny from real estate, too. According to&nbsp;<a href=#>Radar</a>, in 2021, she sold a 4-bedroom home for&nbsp;$555K after&nbsp;reportedly purchasing it in 1996 for $252K. Additionally, <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a> claims that a home she bought in 2012 for $512K is now worth $1 million, at least.</p><p dir=ltr>But it's not just property Kandi is interested in; she's also into cars. The star told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> in 2019, "I have a ridiculous amount of cars right now — eight cars." She revealed that one of those purchases was extra special for her, dishing, "My favorite splurge was a hardtop Lexus convertible. I remember driving and being like, 'Oh, this is it.'"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmb29jaIN2e8qapZ2hXZfCs77UrKpmppWperi70a2fZqGjYrqwvsRmq6GZnmLGsMGMrZ%2Bipptk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ashton-kutchers-twin-brother-feels-about-their-relationship-michael-kutcher.html><span>←</span><span>How Ashton Kutcher's Twin Brother Feels About Their Relationship</span></a>
