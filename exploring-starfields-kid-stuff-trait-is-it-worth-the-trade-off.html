This allows you to pay them a visit when you’re taking a break from your galactic adventures. However, this convenience comes with a price – a 2% reduction in your in-game Credits every week. Keep an eye out for your parents as they might surprise you by popping up in unexpected locations, such as Neon, leading to some amusing encounters.</p><p>In addition to these meetings, your in-game parents may occasionally present you with special gifts. These items are typically unique and cannot be acquired through regular gameplay, unless you resort to cheats through console commands. For those who enjoy a bit of mystery, we’ve kept the specific gifts under spoiler tags.</p><h2>Should You Opt for the Kid Stuff Trait?</h2><p>Many players find the “Kid Stuff” trait worthwhile due to the exclusive gifts bestowed by their in-game parents. Despite the weekly Credits deduction, the engaging interactions with your virtual mom and dad are what truly make it a valuable choice for numerous Starfield enthusiasts.</p><p>Although there is a cost in terms of in-game Credits, the combination of valuable gifts and immersive interactions with your in-game parents establishes the “Kid Stuff” trait as a popular and advantageous option for a large number of Starfield players, enriching both the gameplay experience and the narrative elements within the game.</p><h2>Starfield – An Overview</h2><p>Starfield, a creation of Bethesda Game Studios, was introduced during Bethesda’s E3 presentation in 2018. Set in a space-themed universe, this action role-playing game represents Bethesda’s first new intellectual property in almost thirty years. It is scheduled for release on September 6, 2023, for Windows and Xbox Series X/S platforms.</p><p>Receiving critical acclaim, Starfield has been praised for its open-ended gameplay, combat mechanics, stunning visuals, captivating music, and enhanced technical performance compared to previous Bethesda titles. However, opinions on its storytelling and exploration components have shown more diversity among critics.</p><h2>Overview of Starfield Gameplay</h2><p>Starfield immerses players in an action RPG experience within an open-world Milky Way galaxy, featuring over 1,000 planets, moons, and space stations waiting to be explored. Players can seamlessly switch between first-person and third-person viewpoints. The game showcases procedurally generated landscapes enriched with handcrafted elements, encompassing varied terrains and alien life forms influenced by the planet’s star and atmosphere. The bustling city of New Atlantis stands out as a colossal dominion within the game. Players can enlist NPCs to join their crew, assist in battles, and engage in interactions with other in-game characters.</p><p>Character customization options include body types, appearances, backgrounds, and traits that impact gameplay. As characters progress, they can enhance their skills across five distinct skill trees, with an array of weapons and attachments at their disposal. Jetpacks aid in both combat scenarios and traversal. Planetary surveys unveil resources, while outposts can be established for research and crafting purposes. Players have the freedom to own and customize spacecraft, engaging in trading exchanges or combat encounters with NPC ships, and even boarding them.</p><h2>Insight into Starfield Specifications</h2><p><span></span></p><table cellspacing=0><tbody><tr><td><h4>Specifications&nbsp;</h4></td><td><h4>Details</h4></td></tr><tr><td><p>Engine</p></td><td><p>Creation Engine 2</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Platforms</p></td><td><p>Xbox Series X and Series S, Microsoft Windows</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Developers</p></td><td><p>Bethesda Game Studios, id Software</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Genres</p></td><td><p>Shooter Video Game, Action role-playing game</p><p>Action-adventure game, Nonlinear gameplay</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Mode</p></td><td><p>Single-player video game</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Nominations</p></td><td><p>The Game Award for Most Anticipated Game</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Composer</p></td><td><p>Inon Zur</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>TRENDING</p><p><i>Disclaimer</i>: The above information is provided for general informational purposes only.
