Old-school horror. I think there's a trade edition coming this summer, but there's a limited from Earthling Publications. Nice book. Check their website. Might still be 1 or 2 available.</p>— Stephen King (@StephenKing) <a href=#>March 21, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=299 data-current-count=299 data-injectable=false>What could be scarier than anything put to the page lately, though, is the fact that this all comes on the day of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Donald Trump’s </a>alleged indictment surrounding his relationship with adult entertainment actress Stormy Daniels. Here, King is airing out his thoughts on the situation at present.</p><p data-characters=191 data-current-count=490 data-injectable=true>Having a writer air their opinions surrounding societal unrest on the internet is like giving <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">John Wick</a> a pencil.

It will be because he paid hush money after having sex (while married) to a porn star and tried to write it off as legl expenses.</p>— Stephen King (@StephenKing) <a href=#>March 18, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=332 data-current-count=632 data-injectable=true>Still, that’s not what we’re here to talk about. Instead, let’s focus on an author’s work and how it found its way into the hands of Stephen King. Originally published in 2021, Boys in the Valley focuses on a bunch of Pennsylvania orphans as they battle an ancient and demonic evil. What’s not to love?</p><p data-characters=231 data-current-count=231 data-injectable=false>If it’s good enough for Stephen King, it’s good enough for us. Politics aside, sometimes it’s nice to focus on an artist’s work and give someone a well-deserved pat on the back.
