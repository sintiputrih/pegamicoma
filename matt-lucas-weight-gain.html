Since then, fans have expressed concerns about his appearance. Barry, an Australian comic legend, died at the age of 89 in a Sydney hospital, surrounded by his loved ones. Fans are wondering if Matt has gained weight again after seeing a picture of him in a larger shape on Instagram.</p><p>No, Matt Lucas didn't gain weight in 2023. The photo that has grabbed fans' attention regarding his transformation is from the time when he was in a big frame. But he did undergo weight loss in the past, which has already been discussed by many fans. As he is the same as he was after weight loss, let us discuss his weight gain during his career.</p><p>Matt Lucas has experienced a spectacular makeover in which he has lost several pounds, which has astonished The Great British Bake Off fans. Even though the 48-year-old initially blamed his weight gain on consuming too many of the sweet goodies available in the white tent, there appears to be a lot more sad explanation at work.</p><p><strong>Kevin McGee</strong>, Matt Lucas' ex-husband, tragically committed suicide in 2009, just 10 months after divorcing Matt in High Court. In discussing his loss, the Little Britain star said that he began eating lots to help him cope. "Once you get a little bigger and your metabolism changes, it's different from the person who never got big," he explained on Birmingham City footballer <strong>Troy Deeney</strong>'s new podcast, Deeney Talks.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2023/05/matt-lucas-weight-gain-2023.jpg alt="Matt Lucas had a massive weight gain a few years ago." width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Matt Lucas had a massive weight gain a few years ago.<br></strong><strong>Source: The Sun</strong></p><p>He once <a href=# rel=noopener>claimed</a> that he couldn't fit on the screen. He was in the Bake Off tent and was eating so much that he said, 'At some point, he was going to walk out and be wearing this tent'. It was excessive. Most people who are <a href=# rel=noopener>overweight </a>do not desire to be that way. With their weight, he worries about what happens if they prefer sweets in their food. It's good to have some chocolate. He was obsessed with chocolate of all colors."</p><p>Doctors then informed the comedian that same year that he was at risk of acquiring diabetes and that he needed to cut his daily calorie consumption. Matt Lucas heeded the warning after his father died of a heart attack in 1996, but gained weight again later in lockdown. His father was 52 years old and not overweight, but he died of a heart attack. He wanted to do something about it, and then COVID came along, and he noticed that a big proportion of those dying from COVID were guys, and they were large, and he thought, "He has to do something." He tried everything [to reduce weight].</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2023/05/matt-lucas-weight-gain-loss.jpg alt="Matt Lucas is in proper condition after the transformation." width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Matt Lucas is in proper condition after the transformation.<br></strong><strong>Source: Instagram</strong></p><p>And, even though it was merely food for him (he doesn't do drugs, smoke, or drink frequently), he no longer eats as much. The comic appeared to be in excellent health. When asked how shedding the body fat he accumulated during lockdown affected him daily, the presenter stated that he felt relieved. He remarked that, while he still has a stomach, he is far from skinny. He just lost weight and is now a size medium.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7%2FIp5ueqKSde6S7zGikmqykYrm2r8CsZLCdmZy1tXnGmqCnZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fred-lynn-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Fred Lynn Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</span></a>
