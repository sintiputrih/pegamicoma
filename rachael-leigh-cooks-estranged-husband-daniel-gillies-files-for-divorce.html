We move forward.”</p><p>The Canada native echoed his ex’s sentiments during an interview in January, calling her his “best friend.”</p><p>While discussing his plans for his first Valentine’s Day as a single man, Gillies revealed that the pair never celebrated the holiday while together.</p><p>“Not to sound unromantic because Rachael and I had a very loving and wonderful relationship, but we never paid the day much heed,” he told <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight Canada</a> at the time. “To us, every day was special when we were married.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Despite not putting the legal wheels into motion until this month, the pair took steps forward regarding their new life apart earlier in the year by listing their Studio City, California, home in May.</p><p><a href=#>Variety</a> reported that the former couple priced the four bedroom four and half bathroom house at $4.785 million.
