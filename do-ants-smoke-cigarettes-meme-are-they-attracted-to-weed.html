After the meme of the ant smoking cigarettes has gone viral, people searched the particular question on the web many times.</strong></p><p>A simple meme going viral and taking over the internet is nothing new or unique in this millennial era. The ant smoking meme has recently swept over the internet and Twitter.</p><p>The online space is common, and a new meme is going widespread. Memes emerge from social media and spread across numerous channels, creating a buzz. The same thing happened recently.</p><p>There was a meme where someone googled the topic “do ants smoke cigarettes?” and the response shocked them. That screenshot is the true meme that drew the internet user to search the question repeatedly.</p><p class=ez-toc-title>Table of Contents</p><span class=ez-toc-title-toggle><a href=# class="ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle" aria-label="Toggle Table of Content" role=button><span><span class=ez-toc-icon-toggle-span></span></span></a></span><ul class="ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 eztoc-toggle-hide-by-default"><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1" href=# title="Do Ants Smoke Cigarettes?">Do Ants Smoke Cigarettes?</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2" href=# title="Meme – Are Ant Attracted To Weed?">Meme – Are Ant Attracted To Weed?</a></li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=do-ants-smoke-cigarettes></span>Do Ants Smoke Cigarettes?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>No, obviously, the ant does not smoke cigarettes.</p><p>The fact that ants do not smoke is a reasonably well-established and well-known answer to the audience. However, according to a viral meme found on Google, Ant smokes and enjoys sharing their cigarettes with their buddies, among other things.</p><p>Google’s fantastic response transformed it become a hilarious meme. It’s almost sure that this meme template will be used to create a variety of additional humorous memes.</p><p>Let’s take a look at ant smoking from a biological standpoint and how it affects them. Nicotine, which is present in cigarettes, can harm ants. Nicotine, according to certain studies, boosted the ants’ movement speed. It also reduced their reaction precision, pheromone response, and food consumption.</p><p>This demonstrates that smoking cigarettes are harmful to human lungs and tiny species like ants.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=meme-%e2%80%93-are-ant-attracted-to-weed></span>Meme – Are Ant Attracted To Weed?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As a result of the meme bringing smoking ants to the public’s attention, let us learn if ants are drawn to marijuana.</p><p>Ants are certainly unable to consume marijuana. Arthropods, on the other hand, are drawn to marijuana plants.</p><p>Because of the honeydew emitted by whiteflies and aphids, they are drawn to marijuana plants. Whiteflies and aphids benefit from the presence of ants in the ecosystem. Whiteflies and aphids produce honeydew that ants enjoy, and as a result, these destructive insects will be protected from their natural predators.</p><p>The ants do not destroy the cannabis plant, and they do not smoke it. But, for biological reasons, they are attracted to weed plants.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJyfYq6vwNJmqqanm5p6pLXGmqmerKSawG65xKacZpmimnq1tMSyZJqspKeupMDEnWStp12ssqawjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./roger-lawrence-miller.html><span>←</span><span>Did You Know Gail Millers Husband Kim Wilson Is An Attorney?</span></a>
