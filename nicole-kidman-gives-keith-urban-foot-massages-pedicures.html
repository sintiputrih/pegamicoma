She also always smells good and looks good. I teach my daughters [to be] the same. I’m like, ‘You need to smell good, look good, take care of your skin, file your nails and take care of your feet. Do it yourself, it’s your responsibility,’” the Big Little Lies actress tells InStyle.</p><p class=p1>She explains that prioritizing these beauty habits isn’t about simple hygiene — it’s “about how they enter the world.” Kidman follows her own advice too, taking time to get herself ready every morning, even during quarantine.</p><p class=p1>“I try to make myself presentable in the morning. It’s so easy not to even both in quarantine … I feel better inside when I decide to do my hair and put on a dress — not just my same old <a href=# data-link=1>sweatpants</a> or jeans.”</p><p class=p1>That said, her beauty routine is far from time consuming — it only take 5-minutes flat.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“I’m a five-minute girl in the morning and at night. I’ve got to put my kids to bed and spend time with my husband. I’m not going to sit there for an hour pampering myself,” she says.</p><p class=p1>But with a short routine, effective products are a must. That’s part of the reason why Kidman partnered with CBD brand Seratopicals.
