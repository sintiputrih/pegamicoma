When this is all over, flying internationally is going to be very hard for me,” the 25-year-old actress says in the November issue of <a href=#>Marie Claire</a>. “It is just not worth it to buy a first class ticket, because of the cost.”</p><p>Says the star, “I’m lucky because my dad taught me to be frugal and save. And that’s important because I want to know that I don’t have to take an acting job for two or three years if I don’t want to and that I’ll still be able to make my house and car payments and buy food for my dogs.”</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=666 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Ashley Greene Marie Claire Cover" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Greene, whose other film credits include Apparition and Butter, admits there were some downsides to becoming an A-list star overnight. “It was a hard adjustment going from zero to 100 in a day. But it was also hard to talk to [friends], because you don’t want to be a jerk. After [Twilight] came out, some people said, ‘You changed.’ And I said, ‘I haven’t changed, dude. Your opinion of me has changed because I’m working on this film.’ Trust me, my parents would let me know.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Dating has also been problematic for the DKNY spokesperson, whose exes include “Love Slayer” singer <strong>Joe Jonas</strong>, 23, and Gossip Girl actor <strong>Chace Crawford</strong>, 27. “I’m always here and there — everyone in my industry is — and that’s why a lot of relationships are fleeting,” Greene tells <a href=#>Marie Claire</a>. “I’ve gotten very good at detaching whenever I have to go away for three months, which I realize is hard on friends and kind of selfish.”</p><p>She explains, “You go on a couple of dates, and then someone ships off to do a movie. It’s not like you’re going to fly out and see them, because it’s not serious enough for that.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJisoJyaxm6z0Z6cp51dqcSquMign61lmJbAbr7UoqWenF2ism5%2Bj2ppam1hZXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./anna-faith.html><span>←</span><span>Anna Faith is an Instagram model and cosplayer who has a net worth of $300,000.</span></a>
