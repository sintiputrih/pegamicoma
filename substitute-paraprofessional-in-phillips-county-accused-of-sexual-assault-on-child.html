The officer found a male and female in the car. The parties were released at the scene.</p><p>Police later discovered that the male provided the officer with a false age and was a high school student at Holyoke High School and the woman, identified as Yessenia Janet Cruz, of Holyoke, was a substitute paraprofessional at the school.</p><p>The police department began an investigation into their relationship, which was sexual. They relayed this information with administrators of the high school and the Holyoke School District.
