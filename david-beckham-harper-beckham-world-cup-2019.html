Harper wanted to get in on the action and held up her hand for a high five, except David initially missed it. Finally, David happily obliged and gave Harper a reassuring pat on the back, letting her know that he didn't forget her.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Ahead of the match, David and Harper had the opportunity to meet the English women's national team, who are known as the Lionesses. David shared a picture on Instagram with a touching and relatable caption:<br></p>So lucky to get to see the girls before tonight’s big game... As a player I know exactly what it means to play in these competitions and to have the support from home which means so much..I just want to say how very proud we all are of every single player, they are doing amazingly well and the whole country is behind them !!!
