Dempsey stood a solid distance behind the Euphoria star, who gave the camera a big thumbs up.</p><p>Fans <a href=#>quickly lost their cool</a> over the sweet snapshot, using the reunion as an excuse “to watch Grey’s from the beginning again.” Another avid viewer of the medical drama joked, “Am I dreamin’ or is it steamy out here,” referencing Dane and Dempsey’s nicknames on the series.</p><p>Dane starred as Dr. Mark Sloan (a.k.a. McSteamy) on the beloved ABC series from 2006 to 2012. When it was announced that <a href=#>he would not be returning to the show</a> for season 9, Dane told <a href=#>TV Line</a> that he was “extremely grateful” for his Grey’s Anatomy family. “It has been wonderful to work alongside and learn from a creative force such as <a href=#><strong>Shonda Rhimes</strong></a>,” he said of the show’s creator.</p><p>Three years later, Dempsey’s Derek Shepherd (lovingly known as McDreamy) made his final appearance on the show after 11 seasons. Longtime costar <a href=#><strong>Ellen Pompeo</strong></a> admitted in December 2018 that <a href=#>she hadn’t been in touch</a> with the Can’t Buy Me Love actor since <a href=#>his dramatic departure</a> from the series in 2015.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Eric-Dane-Patrick-Dempsey-reunite-6-feet-apart.jpg><p>“I have no hard feelings toward him, he’s a wonderful actor we made, you know, the best TV you could make together,” the 50-year-old actress said during an appearance on Red Table Talk. “Typically when people leave the show, they need to sort of re-find themselves, who they are, without the show, because the show takes up so much of your life. You need that time to <a href=#>figure out who you are</a> without the show.”</p><p>Despite Dempsey’s unexpected exit from Grey’s Anatomy, Pompeo reassured fans of the series that <a href=#>she would “always have a place” in her heart</a> for her former costar.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGagqpWuwG6tzZqrqKWpqHqmvsicZJ2Znpp6sa3Tq6Cco12Zsq680p6wZqqVqruqwMRmbWaelZrBbq3PmqmtZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./clarissa-kaye-mason-net-worth-61340.html><span>←</span><span>Clarissa Kaye-Mason Net Worth</span></a>
