She and her husband are competing on HGTV’s Battle on the Beach. Who is she? How old is she? Who are her family members? This article covers all the details you came looking for.</p><p>So, keep scrolling down this bio to read all about her.</p><h3><strong>Kelsey Mansingh On HGTV’s Kelsey Mansingh</strong></h3><p>Six new episodes of HGTV’s Battle on the Beach debuted on Sunday, June 4, at 9 p.m. ET/PT. The big news is that this round’s judges will be Renovation Island’s Sarah and Bryan Baeumler. If you haven’t seen Battle on the Beach’s first two seasons, the basic premise is as follows: In Gulf Shores, Alabama, three teams of aspiring home renovators compete to add the most significant value to a trio of two-bedroom, two-bath seaside homes.</p><p>In addition to their instructors, HGTV design professionals Taniya Nayak (Build it Forward), Ty Pennington (Rock the Block), and Alison Victoria (Windy City Rehab), have a $90,000 budget to work with. Who wins the $50,000 cash is chosen by the judges and a panel of regional real estate professionals.</p><p>Season 3 of Battle on the Beach will feature more than just new judges. This time, one of the properties will have an additional 200 square feet rather than three identical homes (whether that’s a good or negative thing is yet to be determined). Prior to the teams beginning their kitchen and dining room makeovers in episode one, a kick-off competition will determine who receives the larger home.</p><p>The contestant competing for the grand prize are married couple <a href=#>Ryan</a> and Kelsey Mansingh of Ohio. Major home modifications don’t frighten the young couple. They were unable to afford upgrades when they constructed a two-story home in Ryan’s hometown of Orlando, Florida, six years ago. So they used FaceTime to FaceTime with Kelsey’s brother, who headed her family’s Helen Scott Custom Builders in Barberton, Ohio, to learn how to create them by watching YouTube videos.</p><p>The others competing on the show are also friends Ashley Basnight and Steve Lewis of Oklahoma, and friends Ben Argall and Pete Meldrum of Michigan.</p><h3><strong>Kelsey Mansingh And Ryan Mansingh Relationship</strong></h3><p>Kelsey Mansingh and Ryan Mansingh have been together since November 2014.</p><p>Gushing about the time they first met, Ryan took to his IG and wrote, “This night was one of the first few nights we had hung out. Just from those few times, I knew something was different about you…. and here we are! It’s been THREE years today that I asked you to be my girlfriend. 😍 Little did I know that we would be married by this time! We’ve had our ups and downs through this journey, but mainly great things through all of it.”</p><p>He concluded, “I am so happy to be able to call you my wife now! It’s the greatest feeling in the world! Thank you so much for dealing with my dumb butt for this long… 😁😝 I can’t wait for the many years to come! Happy three years Baby! I love you so so much!</p><p>Not long after he introduced his lady love on his IG, Ryan wished his now wife her 22nd birthday. He gushed in January 2015, “Happy 22nd birthday to this amazing girl! I’m so glad I met you! Love you so much 😍❤️👵<a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x6umtig x1b1mbwd xaqea5y xav7gou x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz notranslate _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>@kelstrayer</a>.”</p><p>Two months later, Ryan announced on his social that they were celebrating four months together in March 2015. During the time of their dating, they traveled to different states inside the States.</p><p>For the proposal, Ryan took his girlfriend to Paris, France in May 2016. He romantically proposed to her in front of the Eiffel Tower. Ryan announced the engagement on his IG writing, “Sooooo…. This happened yesterday guys!! 😍😆 And if you’re wondering.. SHE SAID YES! 😍😍😍😍 I love her with all my heart and couldn’t have made a better decision ❤️❤️.”</p><p>After Paris, the engaged couple then traveled to Barcelona, Spain.</p><p>Kelsey and Ryan exchanged their wedding vows on <a href=#>16 September 2017</a> in Rittman, Ohio.</p><p>Along with a beautiful marriage, they also launched a joint project called <a href=#>newbuild_newlyweds</a> in 2018. The IG for the project has a verified account with 332K followers. Its <a href=#>TikTok</a> has $1.6 million followers.</p><p>Speaking to WKYC, the married couple shared that they started uploading all their old projects. The couple purchased a 1974 fixer-upper and chose to leave Florida after constructing a brand-new home there for Uniontown. Although the renovations they do may appear simple, there is much more involved, according to them.</p><p>“It’s always a longer process and she’s good at cutting in what needs to be shown and everything,” Ryan said. <span>“Some things take days to do, they take hours,” Kelsey added. “TikTok definitely glorifies things to make it look super easy and super quick.”</span></p><p>The couple doesn’t share any children at the time of this article.</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Kelsey Mansingh Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>Kelsey Mansing’s net worth is above $500 thousand.
