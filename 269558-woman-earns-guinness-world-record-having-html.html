However, there was only one way to find out.</p><p class=dh>Ramdell followed her fans' suggestion and contacted Guinness World Records. She also scheduled an appointment with Dr. Elke Cheung at her local dentist's office in South Norwalk.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>MAKING IT OFFICIAL</strong></p><p class=dh>With an official adjudicator present, the dentist used digital calipers to measure the length and width of Ramdell's mouth, and the results confirmed the TikTok users' suspicions.</p><p class=dh>Ramdell's mouth stretches up to 6.52 centimeters, and after learning that she was a world record titleholder, she was over the moon, especially since she used to feel insecure about it.
