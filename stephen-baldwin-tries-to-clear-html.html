Plus, your money will go into an account, “and then at some point, whenever it’s decided, [the money will] be turned over to” Baldwin, who really “welcomes the support more in a way of other people of my faith saying, ‘We support you being as bold and outspoken about what you believe.’ I receive that support more than any dollar amount. But the truth is, I do have a personal financial situation … If enough money came through this opportunity to clear my debt, I’d be stupid not to do it.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-7d110f6607de09122fbee58a4e1f935e-4-0-0@published data-word-count=54>To be clear, Baldwin believes he’s “just somebody that agreed to be the first recipient” of this kind of charity, and there will be more to follow. Certainly, no one needs charity at this very moment more than a guy who claims he’s “in talks for movies with budgets upwards of $50 million dollars.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-7d110f6607de09122fbee58a4e1f935e-5-0-0@published data-word-count=66>Also, please don’t let donating to Baldwin keep you from giving money to a child in Haiti without a house, school, or doctor’s office: “I’m not suggesting anyone take donations or their charitable giving they’d be allocating for something else and give it to me. This is a thing the dude who started it wanted people to do in addition to their normal charitable giving.” Phew.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-7d110f6607de09122fbee58a4e1f935e-6-0-0@published data-word-count=5><a href=#>Stephen Baldwin Explains RestoreStephenBaldwin.org</a> [Popeater]</p><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Stephen Baldwin Tries to Clear Up That Restore Stephen Baldwin Video</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWloaWdgany0wMSpn56mj5eurbDWoqWYrKKesrSr06iWnKSVlr9vtNOmow%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ruben-morales-height-weight-net-worth-age-wiki-who-instagram-biography-28145-html.html><span>←</span><span>Ruben Morales Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Wiki, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
