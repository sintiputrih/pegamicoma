He worked with Roy Halee to produce the record, which earned praise for its lush, sweet sound. The album proved to be a success both in the United States and the United Kingdom, reaching the top 5 and top 14 spots on the album chart respectively, per Art Garfunkel's <a href=#>official site</a>.</p><p dir=ltr>"Angel Clare" includes among its offerings the single "All I Know." This song, written by Jimmy Webb, became Garfunkel's only hit to break into the top 10, peaking at the No. 9 spot on the <a href=#>Billboard</a> music charts. A second song from the album, "I Shall Sing," also made the charts later in 1973, but it only got as high as the 38th spot. Remarkably, Garfunkel did little to promote this record, which has been his most popular effort as a solo artist.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCEk2psbXFfrLWiwIywmKxlkafBbrPAq52uppuaubR5waKeoJ2jqXqptdNmqqiml2Kup8DEq2SlnZGrtq%2BzjKygpqeeYrSivsWupaSdnGQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-best-snl-political-impressions-of-all-time-watch-w165175.html><span>←</span><span>The Best SNL Political Impressions of All Time Watch</span></a>
