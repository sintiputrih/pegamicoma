From <a href=# rel>parents like Cardi B</a> and Ari Fletcher being spoiled by their little ones, to various rappers shouting out their own family matriarch and co-parents. Among the latter category was <a href=# class=text-word rel>Drake</a>. He had plenty of love to show not only to his mother, Sandra Graham but also to his baby mama, Sophie Brussaux.</p><p>Drizzy and the <a href=# rel>French artist</a> were previously off to a tough start following the birth of their son, Adonis. Of course, the "God's Plan" hitmaker initially denied paternity. He's claimed that the young boy's blonde hair, fair complexion, and bright blue eyes made it seem impossible to him that Drake could possibly have a child. The paternity test obviously didn't lie, though, as he's had his son frequently by his side ever since. After taking some time to heal, he and Brussaux have also been able to forgive and forget their past. They've since formed a strong bond as they continue to raise Adonis together.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel>Adonis Graham & His Artist Mom Sophie Brussax Paint Together For IG</a></strong></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-drake-celebrates-sophie-brussaux-on-mother-s-day>Drake Celebrates Sophie Brussaux on Mother's Day</h2></span><p>@champagnepapi/Instagram Story</p><p>She was seen turning up at one of his concerts a few weeks back. Now, the bilingual artist made an appearance on Champagne Papi's IG Story for Mother's Day, looking radiant on a boat ride with her little boy. The lyricist didn't include a caption to go along with the striking image of her and Adonis. Still, the message of love for his family he was trying to get across clearly came through.</p><p>Aside from the tribute to Brussaux for baring his first-born son, Drake also took the opportunity to praise his own mother. The Canadian artist was famously raised by a single Sandra Graham in Toronto, later spending summers with his <a href=# rel>father, Dennis</a>, in Memphis, Tennessee. He's always been open about his immense love for the woman who brought him up, frequently mentioning her in his music and beyond.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel>Drake & Adonis Link Up With Sandi & Dennis Graham</a></strong></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading>More Love for Sandy Graham</h2></span><p>Keep scrolling to see the photos Drake shared in honour of Sandy yesterday.
