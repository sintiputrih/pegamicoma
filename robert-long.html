Ten minutes later, Long, along with EMT-Advanced Sandridge and Lieutenant Whitaker, reached the scene where Nichols was handcuffed on the ground. You can see him in the bodycam footage, which Police released later.</p><p>Sadly the emergency squad failed to assess Tyre’s situation and 5 minutes later requested an ambulance which reached at 8:55 p.m. At the hospital, the young father spent 3 days; doctors tried their best to save him, but his condition kept deteriorating with time, and he passed away On January 10.</p><p>Had Tyre received the appropriate care, he might not have lost his life. The incapability of Robert and his partners not only tarnished the image of the entire department but also took an innocent, which is why they do not deserve to serve at such a respected job.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Memphis Fire Department Officer Robert Long Parents" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Memphis-Fire-Department-Officer-Robert-Long-Parents.jpg alt="Memphis Fire Department Officer Robert Long Parents" width=450 height=379 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><strong>From Where is Robert Long?</strong></h2><p>According to sources,&nbsp;Robert Long (age 34)&nbsp;was born in a Christian family in&nbsp;1988&nbsp;in Georgia, America.
