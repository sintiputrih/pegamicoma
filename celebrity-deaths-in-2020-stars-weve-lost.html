A true fighter, Chadwick persevered through it all, and brought you many of the films you have come to love so much. From Marshall to Da 5 Bloods, August Wilson‘s Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom and several more, all were filmed during and between countless surgeries and chemotherapy. It was the honor of his career to bring King T’Challa to life in Black Panther. He died in his home, with his wife and family by his side.”</p><p>Scroll down to see Us Weekly’s tribute to the celebrities who died in 2020.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNksKa4xJupoqypYrGmrdOhqmahnmJ%2FcX6PZqqtmaKoerix1Z5kpaejqXykuMifnWaqn5e2r7%2FOp2Y%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gma-host-lara-spencer-is-engaged-to-rick-mcvey.html><span>←</span><span>'GMA' Host Lara Spencer is Engaged to Rick McVey</span></a>
