<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Tila Tequila Gives Birth, Welcomes Baby Girl Isabella Monroe Nguyen</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>She's here! <strong><a href=#>Tila Tequila</a></strong> gave birth to her first child, a baby girl, on Sunday, Nov. 16, the former MTV reality star confirms to <strong><a href=#>Us Weekly</a></strong>. She named her daughter Isabella Monroe Nguyen.</p><p>"I am so in love with her," Tequila (real name Tila Nguyen) tells Us of her newborn bundle of joy, who weighed 7 pounds, 2 ounces, when she came into the world at 7:05 p.m. "She's so perfect and beautiful."</p><p>The 33-year-old first-time mom <a href=#>announced her pregnancy</a> back in April, with a photo of her tiny bump on Facebook. "I truly feel that my baby has saved my life, and I will do whatever it takes to give my little baby the whole entire world!" she <a href=#>told <strong>Us Weekly</strong></a> at the time. "I know I'm going to cry so much when the baby is finally born later this year."&nbsp;</p><p>She added: "I just want my baby to be proud of me and to know how much I love him or her. To love someone else unconditionally is one of the best feelings in the entire world, and I hope I will have plenty more pregnancies to come."</p><p>In the months after that, the A Shot at Love With Tila Tequila star kept fans updated on her pregnancy via her <a href=#>website</a>, where she regularly shared photos of her baby bump and blogged about how she was feeling.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In June, she told <strong>Us</strong> she was hoping for a baby boy, but a month later she announced she was <a href=#>expecting a little girl</a>. "For a long time I thought I wanted a baby boy, but that's because most of my family members wanted me to have a boy," she wrote. "However, deep, deep down inside of my heart I knew that I wanted a baby girl! I wanted a little mini-me so that when she grows up I could do everything with her and be able to talk to her about anything!"&nbsp;</p><p>She went on to express her hopes and dreams for her daughter, blogging, "I want my baby girl to grow up a very strong, and independent woman just like I am, and you know what? I know that she will! My daughter will grow up to be a leader and stand up for all of the people who cannot stand up for themselves. My daughter will be beautiful just like her mama, but at the same time I will raise her to be a humble and loving person who respect herself and others."&nbsp;</p><p>The then-pregnant star even hinted that she'd chosen a name for her daughter. "It's the perfect name for her as well as the meaning behind it!" she teased. "But of course that will be kept a secret for the time being."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGatoZyWerWx0K6gpZldnLa3sdJmmaKqpJ16uLHLnKamnaNir6Ku2GaeoqqcYra0rcGeo6WZXaK8r77OnmSnn6Wusq95kWlobWlnZn5w</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-9-best-hunter-x-hunter-arcs-ranked.html><span>←</span><span>The 9 best Hunter x Hunter arcs, ranked</span></a>
