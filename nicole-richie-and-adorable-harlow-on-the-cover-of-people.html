She just has such an expressive face, like she finds the world funny. Her mom Nicole Richie, 27, has gone through her public trials with drug abuse and multiple DUIs and has come out the other side intact and healthy, if still a bit thin. You can tell that Nicole dotes on nine month old Harlow and that having a baby has really changed her attitude, outlook, and life. In the article to accompany her cover story in People, Nicole’s boyfriend and Harlow’s dad, Joel Madden, talks about what a great mom she is and how she works hard for their little daughter:</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i153.photobucket.com/albums/s218/celebitchy/08octobera/nicolerichiecover.jpg align=left hspace=12 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> She purees her own green beans and records her daughter’s every smile in a journal – making her “the best mom I’ve ever seen,” Joel Madden, speaking in PEOPLE’s latest cover story (on sale Friday), raves about girlfriend Nicole Richie.</p><p>Richie and Madden just moved into a new L.A. home after spending the summer touring with Madden’s Good Charlotte band, and are in the midst of organizing an Oct. 19 walk in L.A. to help end family homelessness. But when they spoke with PEOPLE, what they really enjoyed talking about was their 9-month-old, Harlow.</p><p>Nicole: “Harlow’s a delicate soul. She studies people. She’s very coy. People say that she and I make the same expressions. But everyone says she looks like Joel.”</p><p>Joel: “I’m cool with it, as long as she doesn’t look like me in a wig when she’s 16. I like that she looks like me – it’s my get-out-of-jail-free card.”</p><p>Nicole (on maternal responsibilities): “I think my sense of self is still the same. But I don’t do things, we do things. I work around her.”</p><p>Joe: “Nicole is completely dedicated. I do whatever she tells me to do. I’m cool with that. She’s really good with the baby. I’m really good with finances. All of Harlow’s education and all that stuff, I already have planned.”</p><p>Nicole (on marriage plans): “When we get married, everyone will know. It will happen when it happens.</p><p>Joel (on having more kids): “If it could be as easy as Harlow, sure.”</p><p>[From <a href=#>People</a>]</p><p>One thing that’s also changed for Nicole and Joel is their dedication to charity. They founded the Richie-Madden Children’s Foundation right before Harlow was born and have since raised thousands for charity. Their current campaign is dedicated to building a playground at the facility for homeless families, Beyond Shelter, in Los Angeles. You can help and donate $5 by texting CHILD to 90999. Here’s a link<a href=#> to a video that features Nicole</a> visiting with the children and families there. (It’s set to music and there isn’t talking until the end when a little girl recites a poem.)</p><p>Nicole really has changed her life around since becoming a mother and she’s sincere about it. You can see how that adorable little girl would provide plenty of inspiration.</p><p>Now that Nicole and Joel have moved they’re just a bit farther from Joel’s twin, Benji, and his girlfriend, Paris Hilton. Benji used to live right down the street and his proximity was said to be annoying Nicole after he took up with Paris. If Paris and Benji have kids together Nicole will never escape her.</p><p>Nicole Richie is shown out at DUI class on 10/6/08.
