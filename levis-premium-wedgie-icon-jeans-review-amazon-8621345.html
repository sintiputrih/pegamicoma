But this story isn’t about sweats, nor is it about what I packed to come to Minnesota, which, by the way, just received 10 inches of snow — even though it’s spring! Instead, I’m going to tell you about a pair of pants that are polar opposite to sweats; I’m not wearing them right now, but I have been wearing them nonstop in NYC, and that’s worth calling out as I currently daydream about being back in the snow-free Big Apple.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Said pants I’ve been wearing on repeat aren’t trousers, though you will catch me in the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>office-friendly style</a> quite often. Instead, it’s a pair of jeans — jeans so flattering, so comfy, and so incredibly good that I would go so far as to crown them <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">my most-loved pair at the moment</a>. I know — it’s a bold claim, especially since I’ve tried a lot of designer denim that’s pretty darn impressive, too, but this option stands out because of one additional factor: the price.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Enter: <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Levi’s (literally) iconic wedgie jeans</a> that, unlike the name might suggest, don’t actually give you a wedgie (lol). Instead, they give your butt the best boost, which is one of the many great things about this particular pair of blues. While I certainly am also a stretch-denim lover, I think it’s important to have a good balance between stretch and rigidity — this pair leans more rigid, with a minimal amount of elastane (aka stretch) woven in, so I don’t feel totally constricted in them. In fact, I recently wore them for a day spent in Central Park, and they were comfy from step one to step 20,000.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-levis-premium-wedgie-icon-fit-jeans></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Levi's Premium Wedgie Icon Fit Jeans</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">They’re comfy, flattering, and versatile, everything I want and need in a good pair of jeans. The price also is pretty great; they usually cost $98, but right now, they’re on sale for $71 — a steal, IMO. Given the fact that Levi’s last a long time and only get better with wear, I think these are a worthy investment, which is why I’ll be stocking up on a few more pairs.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Levi’s jeans are beloved for a reason, but it bears repeating just how beloved they are. Fashion editors, like me, swear by the brand’s jeans, and in-the-know celebs like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Kylie Jenner</a> and Jennifer Aniston have been spotted in the label’s blues, too. In fact, Aniston even went so far as to say Levi’s will <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>never go out of style</a> — and she's right. The brand has been around for decades, and one of the most sought-after thrift finds are, in fact, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>vintage Levi’s</a>. The same can’t be said about other brands, which proves its enduring impact in the denim space.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ready to only wear Levi’s from here on out? Sorry to your other denim, but these simply can’t be beat.
