In a 2008 interview with <i>Rolling Stone,</i> the iconic musician detailed his struggle with authority since his youth, which included being locked up an estimated 17 times. “I don’t like to be told what to do,” he told the mag at the time, noting that <i>Cool Hand Luke</i> “seemed like a documentary of my young life.”</p><p><span>He married five times throughout his nearly eight decades of life and welcomed six kids. Merle was dad to Dana, Marty, Kelli and Noel, whom he shared with his first wife, Leona Hobbs, and Ben and Jenessa, his kids with his fifth wife, Theresa Ann Lane.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Merle-Haggards-Son-Ben-Haggard-Posts-Heartbreaking-Photo-Mourning-His-Father-%E2%80%98He-Was-the-Best-Country-Singer-That-Ever-Lived-.jpg><p><span>“He loved everything about life and he loved that everyone of you gave him a chance with his music,” Ben concluded on Facebook on Wednesday. “He wasn’t just a country singer..
