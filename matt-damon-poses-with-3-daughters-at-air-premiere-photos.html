Next to her stood <a href=#>Stella</a>, 12, who sported a corseted black top with a black floral skirt and <a href=#>Alexia</a>, 24 — whom Barroso, 46, shares with ex-husband <strong>Arbello Barroso</strong> — wearing a gray floral dress. The Argentina native matched her husband in a black long-sleeved mini dress.</p><p>Damon and Barroso’s daughter Gia, 14, was not in attendance at the Los Angeles event. The couple — who <a href=#>tied the knot in 2005</a> — also posed for some photos of just the two of them.</p><p>The Departed actor and his wife have both <a href=#>expressed gratitude for their partnership</a> over the years. “I just know I think we both feel really, really lucky to have met each other so we don’t take that for granted,” Barroso told <a href=# rel=noopener>Vogue </a>in May 2018. “It’s life and marriage, <a href=#>so there’s ups and downs</a> you know, but overall, it’s easy and it’s fun. And he’s such a good dad.”</p><p>The Oscar winner, for his part, admitted during an August 2015 conversation with Entertainment Tonight that he thinks “marriage is insane” when asked about his longtime pal and Air costar <a href=#><strong>Ben Affleck’</strong></a>s divorce from <a href=#><strong>Jennifer Garner</strong></a>. (The exes called it quits after 10 years of marriage and <a href=#>finalized their divorce</a> in 2018).</p><p>Damon continued: “It’s a crazy idea, <a href=#>but I love being married to my wife</a>. So, I wouldn’t tell anybody else about their relationship. But I’m lucky I found my wife. And I guess maybe, if there’s any secret … it’s to feel lucky.”</p><p>In addition to feeling grateful for Barroso, the Massachusetts native previously credited his daughter Isabella with keeping him humble.</p><p>“She doesn’t want to see any movies that I’m in that she thinks might be good,” Damon said of the teenager during a July 2021 appearance on CBS Sunday Morning, adding that<a href=#> she refused to watch his Oscar-winning film</a>, Good Will Hunting.</p><p>“She just likes to give me s—t,” he continued. “My daughter said, ‘Yeah, <a href=#>remember that movie you did</a>, The Wall?’ I said, ‘It was called The Great Wall.’ And she goes, ‘Dad there’s nothing great about that movie.’ She keeps my feet firmly on the ground.”</p><p>Monday’s premiere was a family affair as 50-year-old Affleck — <a href=#>who directed Air </a>— attended with wife <a href=#><strong>Jennifer Lopez.</strong></a></p><p>“She’s brilliant,” the Argo star told <a href=# rel=noopener><i>ET </i></a>of Lopez, 53, during a red carpet interview. “[She] <a href=#>helps me in every conceivable way.</a>”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The pair <a href=#>secretly tied the knot in Las Vegas</a> in July 2022 before having a second wedding ceremony at Affleck’s Georgia residence one month later. The Town actor shares daughters Violet, 17, and Seraphina, 14, and son Samuel, 11, with Garner, 50, while Lopez coparents <a href=#>twins Emme and Alex</a>, 15, with ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Marc Anthony</strong></a>.</p><p>Keep scrolling to see Damon and his family at the Air premiere:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BirrXAjJ2YpqeeYr2wv8SsZLChpJ16dHnDmqygoKSav7R5wK1kmqGiYr2zscyinKudXaW1sMDOrGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./last-performance-final-days-death.html><span>←</span><span>Inside Whitney Houstons last ever performance and troubled final days</span></a>
