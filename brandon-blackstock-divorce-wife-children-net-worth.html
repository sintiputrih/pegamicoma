He is recognized for his work on The Kelly Clarkson Show and Blake Shelton Live: It’s All About Tonight.</span></p><p><span>He was born on 16 December 1976 in Fort Worth, Texas, USA, to father Narvel Blackstock and mother, Elisa Gayle Ritter. He has three siblings; Shelby, Chassidy, and Shawna. Brandon is the stepson to Reba McEntire through McEntire’s marriage to Narvel Blackstock. He is currently 44 years old.</span></p><p><span>Brandon is also quite famous for being married to Kelly Clarkson, but it seems that his marriage has hit the end. Know more about him here!</span></p><h2><span><strong>Brandon Blackstock’s Wife Kelly Clarkson Requests To Be Legally Divorced</strong></span></h2><p><span>Brandon Blackstock’s former wife, Kelly Clarkson, has requested a judge to declare her legally divorced from him.</span></p><p><span>As per the legal documents obtained by <a href=# rel=noopener>PEOPLE</a>, it appeals for a judge to officially sign off her divorce, leaving other arrangements such as spousal and child support for a later date. In a declaration to the court, Clarkson reasoned that she and Blackstock <strong>“both deserve the opportunity to build a new life.”</strong></span></p><p><span>Kelly <a href=# rel=noopener>filed for divorce</a> in June 2020 after seven years in marriage with Brandon citing “irreconcilable differences” in the papers. The divorce proceedings are still yet to be finished. While Kelly said she’ll never be “truly open” about their break-up for the sake of their children. The TV host alluded to one possible reason behind their divorce during a segment of her show, The Kelly Clarkson Show, saying they just may be on a “different path” of life.</span></p><p><span>In September that year, Starstruck Management, owned by Clarkson’s father-in-law Narvel Blackstock, sued Clarkson with claims that she <a href=# rel=noopener>owed the company</a> about $1.4 million in unpaid commission. She later filed a petition claiming that Brandon and Narvel defrauded her by charging a large sum of money while working with the management company. Brandon denied Clarkson’s allegations.</span></p><p><span>While Kelly was initially granted primary physical custody of their children, River Rose and Remington Alexander, Brandon was also seeking $436,000 monthly in spousal and child support.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Brandon Blackstock Was Married Twice</strong></span></h2><p><span>Brandon Blackstock tied the knot with Kelly Clarkson in 2013 at Blackberry Farm, a luxury resort in Walland, Tennessee.</span></p><p><span>They first met on a tour when Kelly worked with Rascal Flatts, and Brandon was a tour manager. They hit off well together and started dating, and eventually got engaged in December 2012. Later on, they got married in October 2013. The pair is parents to two kids together; River Rose and Remington Alexander. However, in mid-June 2020, Kelly filed for divorce from Brandon, which has become quite messy and yet to be finalized.</span></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbiz.com/images/uploads/brandon-blackstock-wife-kelly-clarkson-children.jpg alt="brandon blackstock wife kelly clarkson children" width=650 height=905 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><span><strong>Brandon Blackstock with ex-wife, Kelly Clarkson and 4 children from two marriages (©:The Sun)</strong></span></p><p><span>Prior to Kelly, Brandon was married to Melissa Ashworth in 2001 and had two children together; Samantha and Seth. Unfortunately, their marriage did not work out better, so they parted ways without revealing their primary reason for divorce. As reported by nickiswift.com, what might be going on amid the divorce of Kelly and Brandon, they went all the way back to his first marriage with Melissa. In 2013, a man named Jerry Reed, who was supposedly a family friend, claimed that Blackstock had been “running around on” Ashworth while they were together, according to <a href=# rel=noopener>Daily Mail</a>.</span></p><p><span>But Ashworth still defended him, claiming that he was a model “husband and father” for the family. However, the rumors of his infidelity still circulated through the internet. Unfortunately, those rumors still followed Blackstock even when he was together with Clarkson. In fact, another eye-catching tabloid got released, which included a confession from a woman who had supposedly <strong>“hooked up with Blackstock while he was engaged to Clarkson.”</strong></span></p><p><span>Clarkson apparently took to <a href=# rel=noopener>Twitter to address the allegations</a> as baseless and fake rumors. Moreover, when she confronted Blackstock with those rumors, he denied it, but she was not convinced at the time.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Net Worth Of Brandon Blackstock</strong></span></h2><p><span>Rather than a career, Brandon has been involved in jobs during his professionalism as Kelly claimed during 2020 that he was never a certified talent agent during the 13 years she was with the company Starstruck Management.</span></p><p><span>He is a talent manager for the aforementioned company – and his clients include big names like Blake Shelton, the Rascal Flatts, and Kelly Clarkson and other celebrities like country musicians Clae Bodds, Emily Ann Roberts, and John King, to name a few. He is also credited for producing The Kelly Clarkson Show.</span></p><p><span>According to CelebrityNetWorth, he has an estimated <a href=# rel=noopener>net worth</a> of approximately $10 million. However, it may be more since he also inherits his family’s fortune, as they have been in the music managing business for a very long time.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6CzZpOkunCvxKWcm6qZqbamv46bqZqmlKS7bq7Lmpqkq6SksKx5w6KtqKqTmnq4tcWeZJygmaGxs7HNZqWerF2svLPAxw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-did-my-bitmoji-change.html><span>←</span><span>Why Did My Snapchat Bitmoji Change and Can I Fix It?</span></a>
