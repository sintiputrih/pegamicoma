Since the season wrapped, they’ve been featured on each other’s social media accounts, but have remained coy about what the future may hold.</p><p>“We are just friends right now,” the radio DJ added to <i>Us</i>. “If things progress romantically, we’re going to take our time with that and not worry about the show or Twitter or anything like that trying to make us something that we’re not ready to be.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><span class=caption></span><p>What’s surprised Adams the most is how many people were hoping for such an intimate moment between them.</p><p>“I knew always I wanted to make out with her because she’s gorgeous and awesome, and one of my friends. But she’s not part of my friend group, she’s part of my inner circle of friends. So in Nashville I think it was just too weird. But when we were there, I was like this might be my shot to see if I lay one on her. It was a long time coming for me,” he said. “Then afterwards, she kind of echoed the same thing. I didn’t realize at the time everyone was like, ‘This is totally a Jim and Pam situation’ [from The Office]. They were all rooting for it. I had no idea at all.”</p><p>For the latest celebrity entertainment, news and lifestyle videos, <a href=#>subscribe to</a> Us Weekly’s YouTube Page.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJmam5iaubC%2BjKKlZqiRp66ltdKeqmavlaG5tHnAnZimq12Wubit2KxksJmeqbKledOoZKaZm5p6sMHTZq6irJhisaK6yJ6jpZ1doq6twMGyZLBtYGmCd32O</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-danielle-steel-books-will-be-released-in-2022.html><span>←</span><span>What Danielle Steel books will be released in 2022?</span></a>
