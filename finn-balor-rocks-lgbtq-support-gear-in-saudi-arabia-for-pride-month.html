There is unspeakable horror waiting for those who come out of the closet in that country and it is painful to consider that such a large portion of the world is like that.</p><p>It’s also a very good idea that Balor waited until after he was already on his way out of the Kingdom Of Saudi Arabia before posting this picture too.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"></figure><span class=author-name>Felix Upton</span> <span></span><p>Felix Upton is a seasoned writer with over 30 years of experience.
