The animated version of Shinichi Fukuda’s manga came in 2022, and it immediately gathered a following for its creative premise and lovable characters. In a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">positive twist from typical clichéd slices of life</a>, My Dress-Up Darling actually takes the popular girl stereotypes to a whole new level, showing exactly how perplexing and complex human beings truly are.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=574 data-current-count=574 data-injectable=true>Overall, a general description of My Dress-Up Darling would go as follows: A popular girl with an actual personality becomes friends with a student cast aside due to his interest in knitting. The anime is as quirky as it sounds, and even more interesting and beautifully animated than anyone might’ve expected. With the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">immense success hailing from the first season</a>, a new installment will head into our screens soon, and if you’re like me and have been missing this set of characters just as much as I have, here’s when you can finally reunite with them.</p><h2 id=h-when-is-my-dress-up-darling-season-2-coming-out data-injectable=false>When is My Dress-Up Darling season 2 coming out?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=580 data-current-count=880 data-injectable=true>In reality, the announcement for the second season of My Dress-Up Darling <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">is still pending</a>. However, following the airing of the first season, the show’s producer expressed immediate interest in a potential sequel. Unfortunately, Shota Umehara, the producer of the show, also informed fans that several other projects were taking priority at the moment. In fact, the conception of a second season was not initially in the works, but the overwhelming support from fans compelled the producer to explore possibilities for the future, as long as the demand from fans persisted.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=ja dir=ltr>「その着せ替え人形は恋をする」、続編発表おめでとうございます！！いっさい予定されていた2期ではなく、アニメを見て熱狂して頂いた皆さんや色々なものを買ってくださった皆さんの応援のパワーです！予定になさすぎて仕事ヤバヤバのヤバなのですが、見て喜んでくれる人がいるかぎり頑張ります！！！ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Kd9EaisN1H</a></p>— 梅原翔太 (@kafunsyokougun) <a href=#>September 17, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=415 data-current-count=715 data-injectable=true>At the time, many fans hoped the second season would follow the same airing schedule as the show’s first installment and therefore be released before the end of the year. However, that won’t be the case. With so many projected series ahead, the second season of My Dress-Up Darling will likely only grace our screens in 2024. Hopefully, an announcement will soon be made regarding this brilliant series.</p><p data-characters=515 data-current-count=515 data-injectable=true>Nevertheless, as we all know, the anime continues to follow the same plotline as the ongoing original manga. Hence, for many manga readers, the upcoming story isn’t that much of a secret. And while I don’t intend to spoil anyone, I can assure you that you can expect to see Gojo and Marin once again, reprising their roles as the lonely tailor and the popular cosplayer. Similarly, Sajuna Inui will also make her return to the show. The series will also likely continue to be narrated by Misako Tomioka.</p><p data-characters=161 data-current-count=161 data-injectable=false>For now, we can only wait for an official announcement – hopefully followed by a trailer. In the meantime, you can still find the first season on Crunchyroll.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6msGacoprAtHnUqWSdmaKhtq%2BzjKycmqufo3pzedGeo56Zo5p6uLXNnaawZZOdrrOtwq2cq6tdlrulecyoqZ5n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kylie-jenner-reveals-animalistic-name-of-baby-2-check-it-out.html><span>←</span><span>Kylie Jenner reveals the name of her baby boy</span></a>
