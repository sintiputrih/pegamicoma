Sports broadcaster Gary&nbsp;Lineker empathized with Woods, too, but also felt bad watching him go out like that.&nbsp;"Difficult to watch Tiger Woods struggle and hobble around the golf course,"&nbsp;Lineker shared on <a href=#>Twitter</a>. "It's inspiring to witness his incredible mentality. He never, ever gives up."&nbsp;</p><p>Woods ultimately withdrew from the&nbsp;PGA Championship right before the weekend's final round, per <a href=#>Golf Digest</a>. According to his agent, the "pain and&nbsp;discomfort in his right foot" is what prompted his team to make the decision. "I just didn't play well," he said. Woods was gearing up to come in last place and even struggled in the beginning of the first two rounds. "I didn't hit the ball very well, and got off to not the start I needed to get off to," he added. It's unclear right now what <a href=#>Woods' future career plans</a> are, but either way, he will always be a legend.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcW9ibX15e8%2BaoKCdXai9qr7Ap5icZaCkwrO%2FjKGcq2WYmq6zwIyorK1ln6uys3nTop6eql2svLCw0mapnpuVo8Fuv9OrrKCfnJp8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./natalie-williamson.html><span>←</span><span>Natalie Williamson</span></a>
