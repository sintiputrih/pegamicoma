Oof.</p><p data-characters=288 data-current-count=558 data-injectable=true>Compounding that is a recently unearthed video that appears to show Ballinger <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">performing Beyoncé’s “Single Ladies” in Blackface</a>. It has been pointed out that this may be make-up from a previous performance from Wicked! or Les Miserables, but either way it’s not a great look.</p><p data-characters=284 data-current-count=284 data-injectable=false>Despite becoming the internet’s most hated woman, up until yesterday Ballinger was still theoretically touring her comedy show. The next date was to be on Thursday in Boise, Idaho, though Ticketmaster is now saying that the event (much like Ballinger herself) <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">has been canceled</a>.</p><p data-characters=257 data-current-count=541 data-injectable=true>What comes next for Ballinger remains unknown, though if the allegations that the 36-year-old YouTuber has had inappropriate relationships with teenager are proved true… well, let’s just say it’s difficult to play the ukelele in handcuffs.</p><p data-characters=240 data-current-count=240 data-injectable=false>It remains to be seen whether Ballinger will perform live again anytime soon, though going in front of an audience right now sounds like an extraordinarily bad idea. Then again, Ballinger certainly has experience with making poor decisions.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2SwsLjLnpynZZKWua21zaCcq6tdqby2voyhmKxlkpqyr3nCmqWcnZyasW6txa2cq2WXp7ywucinnmaanJawrLLAnJxmmZyhsqit06Kmp6tf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chance-perdomo-bio-wiki-age-height-family-wife-movies-and-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Chance Perdomo Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Family, Wife, Movies and Net Worth.</span></a>
