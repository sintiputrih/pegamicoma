Gina is also an inch taller than the average height for women’s featherweight, increasing her advantage against many competitors.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/creeto.com/wp-content/uploads/Gina-Carano-with-Dwayne-Johnson.jpg><p>Her height also contributes to her impressive reach (or some of you might call it wingspan, you do you), which measured 66 inches and a half, or 169 centimeters! Three inches and a half shorter than the average reach, but with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">a mighty swing like Gina’s</a>, the lack of reach didn’t matter much.</p><p class=related-post>Read Also: <a href=#>Jason Statham Stays Confident despite Height Difference with Fiance Rosie Huntington-Whiteley</a></p><p>Her tall build also helps Gina reach that imposing girl boss character she mainly portrays in various projects.

According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Way of Martial Arts</a>, height and reach are two essential assets in MMA. With a taller height, an athlete usually has longer reach, which makes it easier to strike and block the opponent.</p><p class=related-post>Also Read: <a href=#>Pedro Pascal In His Young Days: From Professional Swimming To Waiting Tables, Discover Why Fans Love Him Even More</a></p><p>That explains Gina’s impressive record in MMA, with seven wins out of eight matches she fought, gaining the title of the Face of Women’s MMA.
