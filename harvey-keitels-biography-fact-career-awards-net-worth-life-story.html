He was born in Brooklyn in New York City to Jewish parents. He studied at the Abraham Lincoln High School and when he turned 16 years, he made up his mind to join the US Marine Corps. He was also at Lebanon, during the Operation Blue Bat.</p><p>Harvey has earned his wealth from his marvelous acting career. In his 40 years in the industry, he has worked with several renowned actors and directors. In the initial years of his career, he has studied acting under Stella Adler and Lee Strasberg at HB Studio. This allowed him to get some roles in Off-Broadway Production.</p><p>During the 1980s, the kind of the roles which he did earned him a stereotype role of a thug in many movies. He continued to work both for the stage and the films. As compared to the other US actors of his time, Harvey has appeared nude in several movies, including frontal nudity in some films like “The Piano” and “Bad Lieutenant”. This is what makes Keitel one of the more controversial characters in the industry. He has worked in numerous movies like Mean Street, Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore, Taxi Driver, Bad Lieutenant, A Crime, National Treasure, and Inglourious Basterds.</p><p>His acting has earned him several accolades. Harvey was honored with the Stanislavsky Award in 2002 for his contribution to acting.</p><p>He was in a long-term relationship with Lorraine Bracco. In 2001, he married the actress Daphna Kastner. He is the father of three children.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKCRp8OmxYyknKKslaHAbq7IqJ6rmaCdxm6ywJyrZpuRp7KmvoyarpqqlKh6r7HTZq6oqqSdeq21xZ5krKyfp8Zw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dream-renae-kardashian-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-58298-html.html><span>←</span><span>Dream Rene Kardashian Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biogr</span></a>
