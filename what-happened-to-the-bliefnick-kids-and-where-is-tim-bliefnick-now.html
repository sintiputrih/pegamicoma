In 2020, Tim and Becky appeared on the show. When Harvey asked Tim what his biggest mistake was at their wedding, Tim said on air, “Honey, I love you, but, ‘Said I do,'” before he added, “Not my mistake, not my mistake, I love my wife.

When she died, the couple were separated and pursuing a divorce. According to the prosecution, Tim killed his wife because he was jealous and had <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">seen his estranged wife with another man</a>.
