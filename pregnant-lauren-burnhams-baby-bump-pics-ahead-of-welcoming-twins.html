Right now is no different. So so grateful.”</p><p>The former <a href=#>Bachelorette</a> added in a&nbsp;post&nbsp;of his own that 2020 had&nbsp;“completely&nbsp;redeemed itself.”&nbsp;The <a href=#>Bachelor</a> alum also revealed his wife’s July 2021 due date.</p><p>The former&nbsp;reality&nbsp;stars opened up about their&nbsp;“two little miracles”&nbsp;the following week, sharing ultrasound photos. The pair promptly made an&nbsp;Instagram&nbsp;account for their twins-to-be.</p><p>Burnham&nbsp;wrote a note to the little ones while celebrating 13 weeks. “Second trimester here we go!”&nbsp;the expectant star captioned a December 2020 social media upload. “Today I was putting your sister, [Alessi], to sleep and one of you was kicking her in the back. I was so excited that I ran out and told your dad right away. Today was the first day I woke up and didn’t feel nauseous, so knowing that you’re moving around in there put my mind at ease. This week we had an ultrasound and I have to say one of you is very active in there and the other seems to prefer to take it easy. I can’t wait to see if that’s how your little personalities are.”</p><p>She and the race car driver <a href=#>became parents in May 2019</a>, four months after their Hawaii <a href=#>wedding</a>. Two months after <a href=#>suffering a May 2020 miscarriage</a>, Burnham exclusively told Us Weekly that they were in their&nbsp;“second month”&nbsp;of <a href=#>trying to conceive again</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The former tech salesperson was&nbsp;“afraid,”&nbsp;she told Us in&nbsp;August&nbsp;2020,&nbsp;explaining, “I think that’s kind of a valid fear if you’ve gone through something like that or just a fear of having to go through it again. So that’s scary, but you can’t really think of all the scary things you just have to move on. … I think I just have to jump in headfirst.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see Burnham&nbsp;showing her baby bump while hiking, recording YouTube videos and more.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNkvbOxxqeYp6xdoa62vsSnZJutoqO1ornSZpmamqlir7a5z2anopujYq6pscCdZKieXayyra%2FOpqCnn12pxKq60mg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nathan-mackinnon.html><span>←</span><span>Nathan MacKinnon</span></a>
