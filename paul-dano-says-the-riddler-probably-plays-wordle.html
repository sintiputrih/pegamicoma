It feels really good to me to have done this now, and I can enjoy it now, where I don’t know if I would have in my 20s.”</p><p data-characters=43 data-current-count=43 data-injectable=false>The Batman swings into theaters on March 4.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJop5qtnGKxorrOZqqasaNiwamxjKugnZycmr9uvNGomZqanK56sbjAsqpmr5%2Bnsa2xjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./2023-01-19-011923-luka-1549309-706.html><span>←</span><span>Luka Doncic Drops Over $250k For Custom Hellfire Apocalypse Truck</span></a>
