It seems Ric Flair has a high opinion of MJF.</p><p>The Salt of the Earth is devoted to his craft as he never breaks kayfabe, inside or outside the squared circle. His dedication to his credit has won him over with fans who simply love to hate him.</p><p>MJF has been compared to one of the greatest pro wrestlers to have ever laced up a pair of boots – ‘Rowdy’ Roddy Piper. This includes Jim Cornette, who previously <a href=#>stated that Roddy Piper would have loved MJF.</a></p><p>While speaking on his <a href=#>WOOOOOO Nation</a> podcast, 2-time WWE Hall Of Famer Ric Flair talked about MJF and addressed his comparisons to Roddy Piper. Flair said that he seems more of himself in MJF than Roddy Piper.</p><p>“I don’t see much of Roddy in him, I see more of me than Roddy. Roddy didn’t brag about his clothes and stuff like that. This kid, which makes him different, he’s talking about the material things or implies that he has material things that other people don’t have and it really pisses people off. Especially when it’s the truth.</p><p>He’s so damn good at what he’s doing and it really catches my attention but I’ve seen so many guys in the business go out and be a hero on TV and then in the parking lot sign autographs. Instead of running to the bar at 100 miles an hour, they want to make sure nobody tweets about what an asshole they are by signing autographs. Dumbass. What heel signs an autograph?”</p><p>MJF also recently said that he&nbsp;<a href=#>is an attraction like Andre The Giant</a>. Bully Ray also believes that&nbsp;<a href=#>MJF could verbally eviscerate CM Punk.&nbsp;</a>We will have to wait and see how AEW will book CM Punk and MJF’s feud in the coming weeks as it continues to intensify every week.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>h/t to Fightful for the quotes</p><p><strong>What’s your take on this story?
