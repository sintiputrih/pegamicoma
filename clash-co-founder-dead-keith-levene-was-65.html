He achieved fame after forming The Clash with guitarist Mick Jones and bassist Paul Simonon at just 18 years old. It was Levene and manager Bernard Rhodes who convinced vocalist Joe Strummer, then the frontman for the 101ers, to join the band.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/11/clash-co-founder-dead-keith-levene-was-65-3.jpg><p>While he saw early success with The Clash, Levene grew tired of their political songs and exited before they started recording. He memorably contributed to “What’s My Name” on the band’s 1977 debut album.</p><p>He would go on to co-form Public Image with Sex Pistols singer John Lydon (previously known as Johnny Rotten) and bass player John Wardle (known as Jah Wobble). Jim Walker was recruited on drums.</p><p>With them, he enjoyed greater fame, including the hit single “Public Image,” off their popular 1978 debut album “Public Image: First Issue.” The band’s second album, 1979’s&nbsp;“Metal Box,” is regarded as a classic example of the post-punk genre. He left the group in 1983.</p><span class=screen-reader-text>Previous</span><p><span>1</span> of <span>6</span></p><span class=screen-reader-text>Next</span><p class="ad__label ad__label--top">Advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/11/keith-levene-03.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/11/keith-levene-04.jpg><p><span class=screen-reader-text>Advertisement</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/11/keith-levene-05.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/11/keith-levene-01.jpg><p><span class=screen-reader-text>Advertisement</span></p><p>“What happened to me was once I got good enough to know the rules, I didn’t want to be like any other guitarist,” Levene said in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a Furious.com interview</a> in 2001. “I didn’t go out of my way to be different. I just had an ear for what was wrong. So if I did something that was wrong, i.e. made a mistake or did something that wasn’t in key, I was open-minded enough to listen to it again.”</p><p>Levene is survived by his sister, Jill Bennett, and his partner, Kate Ransford.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ransford wrote on Twitter</a>, “RIP keith levene My beloved partner who passed away at our home on 11/11/22 peacefully, painfree, cosy n well loved.

We had our ups and downs that had mellowed over time. My respect for his unique talent never will,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted Martin Atkins,</a> who drummed for Public Image on and off between 1979 and 1985.</p><p>“We’re sad to hear of the death of Keith Levene.
