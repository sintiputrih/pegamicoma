The now-32-year-old has had complicated feelings about the cover since, even <a href=#>re-creating it for the album’s 25th anniversary</a> in 2016. “The wholesale worldwide commercial exploitation of a baby might be iconic, but that doesn’t make it right and certainly doesn’t make it legal,” a lawyer for Elden told Pitchfork of the appeal. A lawyer for Nirvana, meanwhile, said, “We will defend this meritless case with vigor and expect to prevail.”</p><h2 class=sources>Sources</h2><a class=source-link-title href=#><span>pitchfork</span> <span class=svg-wrapper></span></a><h2 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h2><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cl7nqjgdm0000cfogn1k15d6z@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Judge Says Nevermind to Nirvana Baby’s Album Cover Lawsuit</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>The Nirvana Baby’s Nevermind Lawsuit Is Born Again</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlpbGdhZ3yvtdGvmKeZXZi1qrjDZqeoqp5iuaLD0q6grWWemsOmvsyipZ1mmKm6rQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nickolas-ray.html><span>←</span><span>Nickolas Ray - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Career, Facts</span></a>
