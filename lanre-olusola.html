Never start something you are not ready to finish.”</p><p>“Courage is not what we’ve been taught. Courage is taking<br>small and deliberate determined actions, in spite of your fear or shortcomings.<br>Create your own courage today.”</p><p>“…Face your fears and limitations and defeat them by taking little steps per time. By the time you look back to join the dots, you’ve become a conqueror.”</p><p>“You can do anything if you BELIEVE and PRACTICE.”</p><p>“You must first love God and accept His love for you,<br>without this you can’t know what love really is and you can’t give it.”</p><p>“Go out there today and every day – Live to Love; Love to Live for yourself and others.”</p><p>“…LOVE is a genuine dedicated commitment towards the<br>wellbeing of another.”</p><h4>More Quotes</h4><p>“REPENT from killing and destroying people unknowingly through your unbelieving thoughts, words, and deeds.”</p><p>“Life is about dreaming and aspiring. Life is about transcendency and helping others attain their dreams. Believing and hoping the BEST in others is the key to their success.”</p><p>“…We should stop talking about change if we all can’t stay<br>and speak one voice and sacrifice for the next generation.”</p><p>“Perception is everything. Your perception is stronger than reality, your perception is your own reality. The way you see the problem is the problem.”</p><p>“Have a vision, anticipate all that can stop you and put contingency plans in place! A vision gives you current sight, foresight, insight, and hindsight.”</p><p>Nobody ever had it smooth all the way. Success is never a function of luck or chance. It requires time and practice.
