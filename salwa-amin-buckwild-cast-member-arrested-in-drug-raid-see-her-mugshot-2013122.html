MTV reality star <strong>Salwa Amin</strong>, one of nine cast members on the network's series about young adults in West Virginia, has been arrested in a drug raid outside Charleston, W.Va.</p><p>Summersville Police Chief J. Nowak told <a href=#>E! News</a> that the 24-year-old was taken into custody with two other men on Sunday, Feb. 10, after authorities received a tip about a shipment of narcotics being delivered to a home in Nicholas County. The drug task force immediately dispatched a surveillance team, who noticed an abnormal amount of foot traffic in and out of the house.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>According to E!, officers obtained a search warrant and moved in on the property, where they discovered oxycodone pills and heroin. Homeowner Jason Jones told police that Amin and Shawn Booker had brought the drugs to his house to distribute to others. All three were arrested and arraigned on felony charges of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver. They are currently being held at the Central Regional Jail on $200,000 bail.</p><p>The incident comes less than a week after MTV's Feb. 6 announcement that Buckwild would return for a second season. A rep for the network had no comment on Amin's arrest.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasmZysrm6tzKKlZpqlmLi4tcudZJyZo6l6rrHMm5yrZZGnv6a%2F056bZqGeYrGzwcZmqZqhlGLAprGMoZyrZZ2qtLS0zq1ka2hhaH5zfo4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./miranda-lambert-bares-cleavage-in-white-hot-plunging-gown-w159101.html><span>←</span><span>Miranda Lambert Bares Cleavage in White-Hot Plunging Gown</span></a>
