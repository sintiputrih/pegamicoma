Between catching up over a freshly brewed cup of tea or feeding farm animals on the actress’ sprawling California ranch, the <a href=#>mother-daughter duo</a> love spending a lot of time with each other. Things are so much fun for Newton-John and Lattanzi, they even let Us Weekly tag along for a typical day in their life!</p><p>Recently, the two were fortunate to team up together to record their new duet, “<a href=#>Window in the Wall</a>.” To be able to work together “was special,” the <a href=#>Grease</a> alum, 72, recently told Us Weekly. “This song was different because Chloe was singing in my genre and the last time we recorded together [in 2019] … I sang in her kind of younger genre and now she had to sing in a more different way. So we had a lot of fun doing it.”</p><p>Lattanzi, 35, however, found the process a bit more nerve-wracking than her beloved mom. “When we went into the studio for the first take, I was so nervous that I kind of broke down, and I said, ‘Mom, I’m so sorry, but I need you to leave’ … because I was so nervous to sing in front of her,” she chimed in, but at the end, “it was all smooth … the nerves went away.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>And, like every <a href=#>parent-child relationship</a>, there were times of bickering. “We disagree all the time on things,” Lattanzi chimed in. “I think … we’re very different artists, but … where we do really well is, when we sing together. I think that we push each other to do things that we wouldn’t normally do. And then thank each other afterward.”</p><p>Want to know how else Newton-John and Lattanzi spend time together?
