Gibney’s character isn’t just limited to the pages of books, either. She’s been portrayed by both Justine Lupe in <a href=#>Mr. Mercedes</a> and Cynthia Erivo in The Outsider.</p><p data-characters=234 data-current-count=596 data-injectable=true>Where Holly Gibney garners the most attention and fanfare are her appearances in several Stephen King novels, namely the The Bill Hodges Trilogy. But just how many does she show up in? And does she have a novel dedicated to just her?</p><h3 id=h-where-does-holly-gibney-appear-in-stephen-king-books data-injectable=false>Where does Holly Gibney appear in Stephen King books?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Stephen-King-Holly.jpg><p data-characters=389 data-current-count=689 data-injectable=true>Stephen King has a penchant for recurring characters that he likes to pepper throughout different books. Dick Halloran and Randal Flagg are older staples of this, but Holly Gibney is a much newer character. She first appeared in Mr. Mercedes in 2014. Gibney appears in a total of six stories (five of which are full length novels), one of which is a book that specifically focuses on her.</p><p data-characters=388 data-current-count=388 data-injectable=false>Holly Gibney shows up in Mr. Mercedes, Finders Keepers, End of Watch, and The Outsider. You can also find her in the short story called If It Bleeds. Most recently, Gibney was written about as the titular character in <a href=#>Holly</a> by King. Based on King’s fondness for the character (as well as the fondness fans feel for her), we think it’s unlikely that this is the end of Gibney.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeSpLysv46hprBlnZa7unnOn2SsrJWltaa6jKSgp5%2BjYq%2Bwu8qsZJ%2BdkanCs7GMoaalpKlitKquzZ6waA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./edison-chen-net-worth-141364.html><span>←</span><span>Edison Chen Net Worth</span></a>
