In fact, the couple who now happily live together in their $4.3million LA mansion had their fair share of ups and downs and even break-ups before they got to the nearly ten-year-strong marriage we know and love today."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

I was like: 'This guy can talk!'"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/299ae603124f-kristen-bell-dax-z.jpg><p id=exEfFcm1m5jZ data-wc=13><strong>The now happy couple didn't exactly hit it off during their first meeting</strong></p><p id=eLM0s7ue-pxz data-wc=17>Speaking with Good Housekeeping in 2015, Dax gave an insight into his own first impressions of Kristen.</p><p id=eneDH1XpXC-b data-wc=39>"When I met her and her friends, I was suspicious of their unbridled happiness", he said. "I thought, 'Something stinks here; they're in a cult.' But slowly I began to see her positive way of looking at the world.</p><p id=eqX9lRLjTF83 data-wc=31>Two weeks after their first meeting, the Veronica Mars and Parenthood stars met again at a hockey game. This time, they began to show more of an interest in each other.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/cf4c9618a632-kristen-bell-dax-shepard-relationship-timeline-hockey-z.jpg><p id=eleiqxEjtpfG data-wc=12><strong>Kristen and Dax love hockey and both support the Detroit Red Wings</strong></p><p id=eJF-KhqFR-OM data-wc=50>"[We] started to flirt, left, and then a day after that I get a text that says 'Hi, my name is Dax. I violated your privacy and got your number from Shauna. How do you feel about that?'" Kristen told Today. "And I was like 'Excuse me? You sound stimulating.'"</p><h2>When did Dax Shepard and Kristen Bell fall in love?</h2><p id=euFSNnwfbq00 data-wc=30>While it's impossible to say exactly when the couple fell in love, Kristen has claimed she believes she fell in love with Dax before he fell in love with her.</p><p id=eZET6Z8fAoXA data-wc=43>Both actors have been honest that their path to happiness together wasn't always simple. The Armchair Expert host who was no stranger to <a class=hm-link href=#>celebrity romance</a> was in an open relationship prior to meeting the actress, and this caused some tension in their relationship early on.</p><p id=eKmKj9zYrePB data-wc=27>"There was a ton of jealousy, for pretty good reasons," he revealed on The Drew Barrymore Show when discussing the early years of his romance with Kristen.</p><p id=epeICRioYWSj data-wc=7><strong>Now the couple are closer than ever</strong></p><p id=ex-Y2ANDx0fM data-wc=35>"I had been in an open relationship for nine years, I was blacked out a big chunk of my life. You know, there were a lot of things for her [Kristen] to be concerned about."</p><p id=ewn83hSeMaC7 data-wc=38>Dax - who has also been open about his battles with addiction - and Kristen had both come out of relationships and initially, the Frozen actress said there were "no sparks whatsoever" when they were introduced in 2007.</p><p id=ea1RzsyMmpAw data-wc=26>However she went on to say in the same Today interview that: "I fell in love with him way before he fell in love with me."</p><h2>Are Dax Shepard and Kristen Bell still together?</h2><p id=ePyjHhJNElN5 data-wc=47>Yes, the two stars are still together and enjoy celebrating their strong bond on social media, be that through sharing images of a <a class=hm-link href=#>chilled date night</a> or very light-heartedly <a class=hm-link href=#>calling time on their relationship</a>. But while romance between the two has blossomed over the years, their relationship has not been without its genuine issues.</p><p id=eGy1-ncy3kUO data-wc=57>In an interview with PopSugar in 2017, Kristen revealed that the comedian broke up with her after three months of dating: "He sat me down and said, 'I can't have this right now. I think you're wonderful, but I am still dating other people.'" she revealed. However after just a few days the couple got back together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/331938ab1dc6-kristen-bell-dax-shepard-relationship-timeline-jokes-z.jpg><p id=e11bd4P1p8g2 data-wc=6><strong>Kristen and Dax love joking around</strong></p><p id=eG5kct7Cb_3z data-wc=34>Later, explaining how the stars' relationship remained rocky at times, the Gossip Girl narrator said on the talk show Harry in 2017: "The first year, you are working out your kinks. I loved it.</p><p id=eEPXOMCFdTao data-wc=53>"We'd get in a fight — because we would fight, a lot — and I'd, like, yell something then slam the bedroom door, then I'd slam the front door, then I'd get in my car and then I'd skid out the driveway, and then I would sit around the corner in my car.</p><p id=eomhIRGhHiKm data-wc=19>"And it felt so good, and I realized how incredibly toxic it was only after he pointed it out."</p><p id=eN7RFUhBar5R data-wc=42>This rollercoaster ride is the reason why the pair decided to better their relationship through therapy, both joint and by themselves. The pair found this therapy came in especially useful during the COVID-19 pandemic when they spent more time together than ever.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ba84e360b558-kristen-bell-dax-shepard-relationship-timeline-kiss-z.jpg><p id=eUJlhq_qa8qN data-wc=12><strong>Though it's been tough at times, the two have remained strong together</strong></p><p id=efWPsPjNwT7b data-wc=55>"The reality is, if you're living with one human being — I don't care if it's your partner, or your husband, or your wife, whoever it is, your roommate — you need to brush up on your toolbox," Kristen said on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. "Because you will find that person annoying. Relationships take work."</p><p id=ecY4TjYsF-6c data-wc=29>"[Our therapist] suggested that we go to therapy separately, kind of so that we could talk [expletive] about each other," she laughed. "And we did! And it's been great!"</p><h2>Are Dax Shepard and Kristen Bell married?</h2><p id=eYH_gMJd64Pm data-wc=45>Yes, the Hollywood stars got married in 2013 in a ceremony at the Beverly Hills Courthouse for an <a class=hm-link href=#>unconventionally low price</a>. The couple had got engaged all the way back in 2009, but waited for marriage equality to be achieved in California before they tied the knot.</p><p id=egfaNki78scM data-wc=59>In an interview with PrideSource Kristen explained the duo's choice to wait was because they felt it would be disrespectful to their gay friends to get married before they could. "What [were] we gonna do?" she asked rhetorically, "Have a party and be like, 'Look at us celebrating this thing you can't do?' That’s [expletive] putrid," the actress explained.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2b5d54fc9fd9-kristen-bell-dax-shepard-relationship-timeline-allies-z.jpg><p id=ehbYrzazpRK8 data-wc=9><strong>The couple are firm allies with the LGBTQ+ community</strong></p><p id=ek0kvhSgKCIV data-wc=26>While it's been difficult to navigate their careers, their family life and <a class=hm-link href=#>Dax's relapse</a> in 2020 after 16 years of sobriety, Kristen says they're now stronger than ever.</p><p id=ewtntKndR-CZ data-wc=55>"One of the main reasons I love him is that he's also addicted to growth," she said. "He's addicted to evolving and he was like, 'I don’t want to risk this family and I did, so let's put new things in place to make sure it doesn't happen again,' and we're going back to therapy."</p><p id=eBPeZOL5AA4o data-wc=27>In a November 2022 interview with Entertainment Tonight, Kristen explained how she believes the secret to their almost ten-year-strong marriage is their willingness to simply "stay vulnerable".</p><p id=evU4kBi72TLJ data-wc=24>"You've gotta be vulnerable," the Frozen star continued. "We have to be vulnerable when we don't want to be. That's what works for us."</p><h2>Who are Dax Shepard and Kristen Bell's children?</h2><p id=eZxMOzyF5RO_ data-wc=14>Dax and Kristen share two children together, daughters Lincoln, who's nine, and seven-year-old Delta.</p><p id=e9ZlYquopkEh data-wc=50>The pair are super private and choose to keep their daughters' faces out of the media. However, they do share a few <a class=hm-link href=#>rare glimpses</a> into their happy family lives on social media, such as when they recently posted about their family holiday in Idaho with the help of some carefully placed emojis.</p><p id=eLb109B4OCSt data-wc=8><strong>Kristen and Dax on holiday with their daughters</strong></p><p id=eEfmm7DXqyM7 data-wc=26>The couple adore raising their two children and have been branded an inspiration by their fans who love their honestly when it comes to their relationship.</p><p id=eU9oYQm3OaG2 data-wc=4><strong>Read more <a class=hm-link href=#>HELLO!
