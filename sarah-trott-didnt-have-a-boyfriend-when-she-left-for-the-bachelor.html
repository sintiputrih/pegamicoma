While she still wants to find love, her focus is on her family. She’s just trying to move forward with her life and trying to help find a cure for ALS.”</p><p>Sarah, 24, quit <a href=#><strong>Matt James</strong></a>’ season of the show during the <a href=#>Monday, January 18, episode amid drama with the other girls</a>. After the former broadcast journalist crashed a group date to talk to the 29-year-old former football player about her insecurities and doubts about the show’s process, <a href=#>the other contestants made it clear that they weren’t happy with her.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sarah-Trott-Didnt-Have-a-Boyfriend-When-She-Left-to-Film-Matt-James-Season-of-The-Bachelor.jpg><p>Sarah subsequently isolated herself from the rest of the cast and when she tried to apologize,<a href=#><strong> Victoria Larson</strong></a> told her that she wasn’t forgiven. Sarah, who has been open with Matt about her father’s battle with ALS, told the lead she was going home to be with her family.</p><p>“The reason why she left was really because of family reasons and wanting to be there for her father. She also left for her personal well-being,” the source said. “The thing she doesn’t regret is she has been able to be an immense amount of time at home and spend time with her father — that’s something she can’t ever regret.”</p><p>The insider adds that it’s been “really hard” for Sarah to watch the show back as some contestants, including<a href=#><strong> Kit Keenan,</strong> apologize via social media for how they treated her on the show</a>. The source notes that Sarah is trying to focus on the positives, including her ALS caregiver’s community.</p><p>“The time she spent on the show was a really emotional time for her, and now she’s experiencing that same emotion watching it back. It hasn’t been easy,” the source said. “The positive that has come out of this, which she’s really excited about<a href=#>, is she’s raised immense awareness for ALS</a>. She did start a<a href=#> caregiver’s community</a> where she has allowed other people going through the same situation to share their experiences and help each other. This is helping her continue moving forward. She hopes to find people she can connect with and connect others, and let people know she’s there for them and they’re in this together.”</p><p>Following the January 4 premiere, Sarah has also made headlines for partying with <a href=#><strong>G-Eazy</strong> </a>in early 2020. In the recently resurfaced snaps, she <a href=#>was spotted leaving a club in Los Angeles with the rapper</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sarah-Trott-Didnt-Have-a-Boyfriend-When-She-Left-to-Film-Matt-James-Season-of-The-Bachelor-5.jpg><p>“I have a lot of friends in Los Angeles and we are just friends,” she told <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a> about the photos. “Those pictures were taken what feels like forever ago. We’re just friends.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Bachelor airs on ABC Mondays at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p>With reporting by Diana Cooper&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqaqpGderW%2Bzq2rZpyZmbu1ecearZ5lkWKvsMXFq6CeppRixKmxzWaqoZ1dobKnwIyfpqtlpJ2ybq7AnJ%2BepJ%2BnfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./katie-sigmond.html><span>←</span><span>Katie Sigmond</span></a>
