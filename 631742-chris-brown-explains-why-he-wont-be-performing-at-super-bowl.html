The superstar singer has amassed success that newcomers only dream of. However, some still wrestle with the decisions he has made and how they have affected his present and future. By now, most are familiar with Brown's greatest personal and professional scandal: <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">physically assaulting Rihanna</a> just ahead of the 2009 Grammy Awards in Los Angeles. After photos of the "Umbrella" singer's injuries were shared, Brown's career hung in the balance.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Yet, Breezy has bounced back. He's had several<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"> sold-out tours</a>, reached No. 1 on the charts, and his dedicated fanbase supported him at every turn. After <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Rihanna</a> took to the Super Bowl halftime show as her official return to the stage, Brown was inundated with messages about his ex-girlfriend. He seemingly gave her a <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">positive shout-out</a> and answered a fan's question about his turn at the big game.</p><p>ATLANTA, GA - DECEMBER 9: Singer Chris Brown performs onstage during "Lil Baby & Friends Birthday Celebration Concert" at State Farm Arena on December 9, 2022 in Atlanta, Georgia.

Brown answered, "Never shawty.. American media AINT FA me. Rather be where I'm welcomed." This comes months after it was rumored that Brown's American Music Awards tribute to Michael Jackson was<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"> axed at the last minute</a>. It was a performance that was reportedly also set to feature <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Ciara</a>. Rehearsal footage was later shared on social media.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, Brown's prior controversy with Rihanna hasn't been his only hiccup. There have been several lawsuits and <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">allegations of sexual misconduct</a>—and the singer has denied each as they have arisen. In 2017, Brown's ex-girlfriend Karrueche Tran was <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">granted a restraining order </a>after alleging he abused her. Regardless of his past, Brown's fans have agreed that he should go where he's appreciated.</p><span><h6 class=has-small-font-size>Read More: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jordin Sparks Suggests Chris Brown & Rihanna Beef Caused “No Air” Grammys Snub: Watch</a></h6></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Conversations about the singer's indiscretions have also been brought up during conversations about his legacy. There are those that argue Brown should be referred to as the King of Pop, taking the crown from the late-great Michael Jackson. In these discussions, Breezy has offered words of<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"> respect to Jackson </a>while also embracing the accomplishments he's made throughout his career. Do you think Chris Brown deserves more respect from America?
