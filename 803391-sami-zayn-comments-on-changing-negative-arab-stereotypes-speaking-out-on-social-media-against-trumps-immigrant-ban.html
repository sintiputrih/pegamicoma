Ever since I was a kid and growing up and watching things like the ‘Naked Gun’ movies, there was always this stereotype about how Arabs were perceived and portrayed. I’ve never watched those Arab villains in the movie and felt like that was me. They were nothing like me, and now I get to just be me — and hopefully being me strikes a chord with a lot of young Arabs and non-Arabs, honestly. We’re really not all that different.”</p><p>“The impact this company has overseas is overwhelming at times, but it’s like the old expression: ‘With great power comes great responsibility. With a platform that big, and with an opportunity this big, whether you want to be a role model or not, this puts you in a position where you have to be your best; it’s really your duty to be the best that you can be.”</p><p>“I think it’s important for youngsters from all walks of life to have some sort of representative that they can look up to and aspire to be and let them know there’s a chance for anybody from any background. That’s the spirit of America, right? Anybody from any background can make it anywhere with enough hard work. I think the more people from all walks of life who speak up and the more diverse success stories we have, the better that is for our youngsters growing up, knowing they can attain those same goals just like anybody else.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwhI9sanJpXaiurrWMs5iypl2YvK65xKerrGWfo3qktMCnnqKml2K7prPAraCvnV2Wv6KujKyrnqqVpMG6vMSsZKyolZa4qrrGZqaurF2ku26%2FzpygmqRdorKltcBmmKCZmaPAtXnTq6ymqKNitq65yKCpmqakYq%2Biug%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./harold-reynoldss-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html><span>←</span><span>Harold Reynoldss Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</span></a>
