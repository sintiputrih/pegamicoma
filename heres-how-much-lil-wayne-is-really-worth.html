By the time he was 8 years old, he had already composed his very first rap song. Only a few years later, according to <a href=#>Billboard</a>, he signed with Cash Money Records for the first time (after which he would sign for an additional four albums), making history as the youngest member of the label at age 12.</p><p>His claim to fame began when he joined the Hot Boys, a group with Juvenile, B.G., and Young Turk. Their album, Guerrilla Warfare, and its success set him up for the chance to go solo in 1999 with his debut album Tha Block Is Hot.&nbsp;</p><p>Since then, the artist has gained his share of accolades, including not only music awards, but broken records. According to <a href=#>Billboard</a>, Lil Wayne recently topped Elvis Presley with his 2020 album Funeral, after which Wayne had 82 hits on the top 40 Hot 100 list under his belt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmanFnaYJ0e8eeqZ6rXZ28uHnMrpqhZZyeuW7DwLKlnmWZqHqzscClo7Jlp6S%2FtbSO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./abc-news-rhiannon-ally-5-things-to-know-amid-gma3-scandal.html><span>←</span><span>ABC News' Rhiannon Ally: 5 Things To Know Amid 'GMA3' Scandal</span></a>
