"But it was never really our intention to be a boy band," Nick Lachey told <a href=#>Interview Magazine</a>&nbsp;in October 2017. "We put ourselves together and moved to LA and sang on street corners. We weren't auditioned by anyone," he explained. In addition, Lachey fell in love with fellow singer <a href=#>Jessica Simpson</a>.</p><p dir=ltr>Lachey and Simpson wed in October 2002, launched "Newlyweds: Nick & Jessica" in 2003, and split in 2005. As <a href=#>Complex</a> detailed, show producer Sue Kolinsky noted, "He was a blue collar guy — he did a lot of things himself, like he and his brother would build things. He was frugal, and she had excessive taste," she explained. The <a href=#>pair hadn't signed</a> a prenuptial agreement, and Lachey reportedly <a href=#>received $12 million</a> in the divorce.</p><p dir=ltr>In 2011 Lachey <a href=#>married Vanessa Minnillo</a> on Neck Island, billionaire Sir Richard Branson's private Caribbean spot. Lachey kept performing and embraced more reality television with "Love Is Blind," "Dancing with the Stars," and "<a href=#>The Masked Singer</a>" (per&nbsp;<a href=#>IMDb</a>). He's reportedly now worth $25 million (per <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>).</p><p dir=ltr>Ultimately, Lachey is seemingly still a blue-collar Kentucky boy at heart. For <a href=#>the couple's</a> first Mother's Day and Father's Day, he told <a href=#>Celeb Baby Laundry</a>, "We always do what we feel is appropriate." Lachey added, "So I didn't go crazy and I don't think she will either. It means more to us to get something meaningful, and the most important thing is being able to spend it with Camden."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbWpiaYV1e8eeqZ6rXZ28uHnMrpqhZZ6esKx5y5qaoZ2pYra0edGemKWkqWLEsL7ToWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-to-christian-pulisic.html><span>←</span><span>Christian Pulisic Got Hurt Scoring the Winning Goal During the U.S. Victory Over Iran</span></a>
