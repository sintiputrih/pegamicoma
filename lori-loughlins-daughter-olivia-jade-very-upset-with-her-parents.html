She supposedly thinks Loughlin, 54, and her father, <a href=#><strong>Mossimo Giannulli</strong></a>, have affected her career in addition to the other issues their alleged involvement in the scam have caused.</p><p>“Olivia blames her mom and dad for this scandal and for the downfall of her career,” a source told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>, who added that the 19-year-old influencer “was initially trying to shrug off the scandal as something that would pass after a week and she could go back to her life.” Clearly, that’s not how things went.</p><p>“Now that her endorsement deals have fallen through she is very upset with her parents,” the insider continued. “Olivia didn’t even show interest in going to college, she wanted to take time and work on her beauty career, but her parents were the ones who wanted her to get an education.” That’s pretty evident in comments Olivia has made in the past — for instance, she once said in a YouTube video shared to <a href=#>her channel</a> on August 14, “I don’t know how much of school I’m gonna attend, but I’m gonna go in and talk to my deans and everyone, and hope that I can try and balance it all … But I do want the experience … I <a href=#>don’t really care about school</a>, as you guys all know.”</p><p><a href=#>Loughlin was indicted</a> on March 12 after she and her husband allegedly “agreed to pay bribes totaling 500,000 in exchange for having their two daughters [20-year-old daughter <a href=#>Isabella</a> and 19-year-old daughter Olivia] designated as recruits to the USC crew team — despite the fact that they did not participate in crew — thereby facilitating their admission to USC.”</p><p>Well, that alleged work behind the scenes may have amounted to very little. A source told In Touch on March 15 that Olivia isn’t planning on <a href=#>returning to school</a> because “everyone is talking about her and she’s terrified she’ll be attacked by bullies because of the scam. Right now, she feels like her whole life is over!” Between that and her <a href=#>Sephora deal</a> getting called off, we can see why Olivia might not be a very happy camper at the moment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTqKycoKeasqy42GeaqKVfpby0wNJoo6iqmWK5sMHGoaOipqNisaLBxqGrnqpdpLmqwsiaZKOZlJp6t7HRsmSuqKOawW7DyK2fZqCVp3qxrdGepa2rXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-doja-cat-south-african-and-who-are-her-parents-deborah-elizabeth-sawyer-and-dumisani-dlamini.html><span>←</span><span>Is Doja Cat South African and Who Are Her Parents Deborah Elizabeth Sawyer and Dumisani Dlamini</span></a>
