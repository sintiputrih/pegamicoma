 Normally, a fine sandpaper is used, with some wet sanding of the helmet as well. Lacquer thinner applied to a clean soft cloth completely cleans the surface. We selected lacquer-based paint since it is tougher and more durable than other types of paint. It will reduce the amount of paint required.

Paint the whole helmet with priming paint to make it seem white."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
