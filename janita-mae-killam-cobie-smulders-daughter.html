The little girl is now enjoying an affluent upbringing along with her older sister. Born January 2015, Janita is 6 years old as of 2021. Her birth sign is Capricorn. Janita Mae Killam is the younger daughter of <a href=# rel=noopener>her parents. </a>Her parents try to keep Janita and her elder sister, Shaelyn Cado Killam out of the limelight and far away from the media. They don’t share too much information about their beloved girls.</p><p><strong>Janita</strong>‘s mother, Smulders claims that her children are her number one priority. After their birth, she became a bit choosy about work by participating only in those projects she was really interested in. She tells that her daughters always come first no matter what decision she makes.</p><p>The mother announced her daughter’s arrival and she became a parent for the second time while promoting her film&nbsp;Unexpected&nbsp;at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival, in Park City, Utah on Jan 25.</p><p>“I’m in Sundance and I have a 3-week-old baby, so I can certainly relate.”</p><p>Cobie played the role of a teacher who finds herself pregnant and later became a close friend with her student who also got pregnant at the same time.</p><p>She added, “It’s my world at the moment, and it’s just so prevalent in the world today. I’m very lucky where I have a great career and a huge support system and not every woman has that. It’s an interesting film because it shows both of those sides.”</p><p>Her second pregnancy almost coincided with her character in the movie, maybe that’s the reason why she has decided to put Janita Mae Killam and her elder sister as the top priority when it comes to decision making. They initially didn’t reveal anything about their newest kid including gender and name.</p><p>The couple makes <a href=# data-type=post data-id=10497>their public appearance with</a> Janita Mae Killam and her sister, Shaelyn Cado very rarely. Smulders was spotted for the first time with her then newborn baby girl, Janita in late Jan 2015 at Los Angeles International Airport. But, the actress had truly wrapped her up under her coat.</p><p>In April 2020, Taran and Cobie were seen with their kids in their LA neighborhood. Both of their girls were equipped with helmets while their older daughter was riding a bicycle and her little sister was enjoying a scooter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.dicytrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cobie-Smulders-and-her-two-children.webp><p>How did Janita Mae Killam’s parents meet? well, The couple first met back in 2005 through a mutual friend.
