From our evaluation, it is clear that Logic Supply has been able to deliver effectively on the promise of a fanless NUC. The chassis has been designed to adapt the default NUC configuration for the requirements of industrial PCs. The <a href=#>online ordering page</a> provides lots of options for customization.&nbsp;</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/9189/fin-page_575px.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Despite the excellent acoustics that come with being completely fanless and reasonable power consumption numbers, we didn't evaluate the platform for its media capabilities. We also do not recommend the unit as a passive HTPC. Simply put, the platform commands a premium for its vPro capabilities. In addition, the absence of any HDMI port on the board mean that there are less costly alternatives for the home theater market.</p><p>In terms of scope for improvement, we have a spare SATA port on the board. The ability of the chassis to- capability to accommodate a 2.5" drive would be welcome, given that we have already sacrificed on the chassis height. Our review unit also came configured in single channel memory mode, and this leaves performance on the table. In the end, it is a matter of cost to the consumer. Users looking to squeeze every last bit of performance from the machine should definitely be looking at a dual channel configuration. Thankfully, Logic Supply's ordering page allows you to do the same.</p><p>On the positive side, the availability of vPro / AMT capabilities is a very welcome feature in the industrial PC space. The chassis design also accommodates serial I/O and digital I/O pins in an aesthetic manner. The thermal performance is also improved, when compared to the Core-ML320 from last year.</p><p>Despite a couple of minor quibbles (neither of which are show-stoppers), we have to say that Logic Supply's ML100G-30 is an excellent option for consumers looking for a passively cooled NUC with vPro capabilities. Its industrial components lend itself to a multitude of applications such as digital signage, kiosks and the like (even in harsh environments). RS232 COM port and DIO (Digital I/O) support mean that the unit is also ready to participate as a master controller in the industrial automation / M2M / IoT scene. The remote operation / platform management capabilities that come with vPro / AMT only sweeten the deal.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZIZyhJhoo6ifmZh6tMHPqaOyZZ2hfnF8xmxnZp6Ro7mmv9JmmaunkZnEprjLZqCnnKWowbO1wKVkp62TYr%2Bmwsiermhv</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./eva-mendes-brother-reveals-what-really-makes-her-and-ryan-gosling-amazing-parents-to-amada-and-esmeralda.html><span>←</span><span>Eva Mendes' brother reveals what really makes her and Ryan Gosling 'amazing' parents to Amada and Es</span></a>
