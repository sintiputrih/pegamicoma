The 22-year-old billionaire is the queen of gift giving, which she proved with her Mother’s Day presents for <strong>Kim Kardashian</strong>, 39, and <strong>Khloe Kardashian</strong>, 35. Kylie gifted <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>each sister</a> with a cheetah-shaped clutch, but this wasn’t just any designer bag. They were uniquely-crafted “Wildcat Chiquita” pieces from <strong>Judith Leiber</strong>, which cost $5,495 each — that’s a total of $10,990. The gorgeous brass clutches, covered in colorful Austrian crystals and made of Italian leather, sterling silver and 24k carat gold, take up to two years to make. So, Kylie was actually giving her sisters pieces of art.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“I mean seriously Kylie? For mother’s day? How beautiful!,” Kim gushed while filming her cheetah clutch for her Instagram Story on May 8. Kim’s clutch in particular was customized with sapphire crystals, which matched the blue <strong>Dior</strong> makeup bag that Khloe also gave Kim for Mother’s Day. Meanwhile, Kylie gifted Khloe with a coordinating gold clutch, which her older sister also featured on her Instagram Story. “Aww i love you, my sissy,” Khloe wrote over her new accessory.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>The KarJenners are feeling extra generous this Mother’s Day. The holiday is still two days away (May 10), but they’ve made sure to exchange gifts early this year. Kim may just win the family award for best surprise, though. The SKIMS owner sought out and bought the camera used by the wedding photographer at <strong>Kris Jenner’s</strong> wedding to her late ex-husband, <strong>Robert Kardashian</strong>, in 1978! Kim pulled old photographs from this camera and created a one-of-a-kind photo album for her mom.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://www.instagram.com/p/B_8dFXvBVKR/</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-6><strong>Kourtney Kardashian</strong> was sure to send the women in her family a delectable treat: the gorgeous “bomb ass olive oil cake” by Little House Confections. The dessert comes in an Instagram-worthy brown box which Kylie was sure to post up on her feed! “Ok this olive oil cake…Wow,” the cosmetics mogul gushed, hilariously posting a photo of the item with a circular piece cut out. “People were very disturbed I cut my cake how I did so this is for those people,” she later shared, cutting the item in more traditional triangular slices. The cake, which is made using the Bragg’s Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil, also donates partial proceeds to charity!</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Even <strong>Tristan Thompson</strong> has gotten into the gift-giving spirit! The <strong>Cleveland Cavaliers</strong> player, who has sparked hookup rumors with his ex Khloe, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>sent flowers</a> to both Kim and Kourtney on Friday.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH12e49xZqSxnJ6ybrbEp6Weql2Ytaax05qfZpucqsGktMSsZKShnWK4or7DmqqhoZGjeqy0y6icZqWfqbWmvtJmm5qxXaW%2Fpr%2FEp6usZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./khushi-gadhvi.html><span>←</span><span>Khushi Gadhvi - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, In Relation, Facts</span></a>
