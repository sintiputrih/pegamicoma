(She was sometimes credited as "Marian Moses", particularly in her earlier T.V. and film appearances.)Born in Pittsburgh, McCargo attended Boston's West Hills College. Several sources claim she won the tennis' Wightman Cup but a check of the U.S. Wightman Cup team shows no McCargo on its rosters. And, despite claims she defeated Maureen Connolly at Forest Hills in 1950, Connolly, in fact, lost in the second round at Forest HIlls to second-seeded Doris Hart of Jacksonville 6-2, 7-5, on August 30, 1950. (see New York Times, Chicago Tribune, Washington Post, August 31, 1952).In 1951, she married Richard Cantrell Moses, who later became an advertising executive in Los Angeles. They had four sons. Graham Moses, actor William R. Moses, director Harry Moses, and actor Rick Moses. They were divorced in 1963.McCargo first entered acting as a supporting player on such popular television shows as Perry Mason; in 1964 she played murder victim Sibyll Pollard in "The Case of the Latent Lover," and in 1965 she played defendant Louise Selff in "The Case of the Wrathful Wraith." She also made appearances on television shows like Hawaii Five-O, Hogan's Heroes, Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, Mannix, and The Man from U.N.C.L.E..She made her feature film debut in the crime comedy Dead Heat on a Merry-Go-Round (1966) which was also the debut film of Harrison Ford. Roles in Buona Sera, Mrs. Campbell (1968) playing opposite Peter Lawford and also with Gina Lollobrigida, Shelley Winters, Telly Savalas, and Phil Silvers, The Undefeated (with John Wayne and Rock Hudson) and Doctors' Wives followed in 1970. McCargo also became known for her role as Harriet Roberts on the nighttime soap Falcon Crest.In 1970, McCargo married U.S. Congressman Alphonzo E. Bell, Jr. of California, a widower with three sons of his own. She then retired from acting to become a political wife. Using the married name Marian McCargo Bell, she was active politically during his eight-term congressional career and campaigned for her husband, including during his unsuccessful bid for the U.S. Senate in 1976.She died of pancreatic cancer in 2004 in Santa Monica, California. ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=6.5><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$1.3 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>March 18, 1932</td></tr><tr><td>Died</td><td>2004-04-07</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Occupation</td><td>Actress</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actress</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>West Hills College</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Spouse</td><td>Richard Cantrell Moses, Sr. (divorced) Alphonzo E.
