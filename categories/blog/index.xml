Phlegm may be alleviated by inhaling steam from a vaporizer or a bowl of hot water, or by having a hot shower. Cough suppressants that are available over-the-counter may help you get through the day and sleep through the night.</description></item><item><title>Harry Styles' &amp;quot;Adore You&amp;quot; Video Tells The Story Of A Man &amp;amp; His Fish</title><link>/harry-styles-adore-you-video-tells-the-story-of-a-man-his-fish-19431669.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/harry-styles-adore-you-video-tells-the-story-of-a-man-his-fish-19431669.html</guid><description>Harry Styles is exploring what it's like to feel like a fish out of water with the concept of his new music video, based in the fictional island, Eroda.
