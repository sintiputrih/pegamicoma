And that next day we came back and the mood had shifted to where people were mad, the girls, you know, there were tears.”</p><p>In first place, Thomas swam finished at 4:33.24s, according to results&nbsp;published&nbsp;on <a href=#>swimmeetresults.tech</a>.

Gaines claimed at the time that forcing her to compete against Thomas was unjust and that most other female athletes she knew felt the same way. Gaines claimed she and her teammates were confident the NCAA wouldn’t allow Thomas to compete in the women’s national championships with unfair physical advantages like height, muscle mass, and heart and lung size after learning that Thomas had competed in the men’s division for the previous three seasons before making the transition to a woman.</p><p>Also Read|<a href=#>“Female athletes are not okay with this”: Riley Gaines denied trophy over transgender swimmer Lia Thomas</a></p><p>Also read| <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Four to six hour window where I cannot remember anything”: Mary-Sophie Harvey alleges being drugged at 2022 Swimming World C’ships</a></p><p>Do follow us on:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Google News</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Facebook</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiemafAtb%2FPqKmtsl6YvK57xaipnJ2UYsGwedGamp5lkZyuqrrSrWSaZZ2WuaZ5xZ6kmqSVYsC4tcymnKtlop65psWMoJiippWoeq2t0qGcrGWfqsFurcaaoKerpGLBs63NrJ6eppSav26%2F1qKkpp2iYrmqrYytn6ilkah8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alex-o-loughlin-net-worth-124607.html><span>←</span><span>Alex O'Loughlin Net Worth</span></a>
