Code Name: The Cleaner It is accepted practice that a comedy, even the most outrageous one, must have some sort of skeletal plot structure. Most of these are nonsense and sometimes impede the viewer's ability to enjoy the film's humorous antics. Such is the case with C...
Miracle on 34th Street Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus.

<a href=../../../the-beguiled-sofia-coppola-interview-html.html></a>
Underestimate the power of women at your own peril. That’s one of the lessons to be drawn from The Beguiled, Sofia Coppola’s new remake of a 1971 Clint Eastwood film, where a wounded Civil War soldier (Colin Farrell) stumbles into a half-abandoned all-girls boarding school to recuperate. As the man of the house, he expects to be the center of attention — and at first he is, as headmistress Martha (Nicole Kidman), teacher Edwina (Kirsten Dunst), and their girls attend to and dream about him — but as things grow tense, the women have the numbers in this fraught battle of the sexes.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Rob Kardashian Launches New Vanilla Cream Soda Brand</h2><time>Jun 2, 2024</time>

Your prayers have been answered! That is, we’re assuming your prayers were for Farrah Abraham to appear on&nbsp;Million Dollar Matchmaker! The infamous Teen Mom OG&nbsp;star (whose fame skyrocketed with the release of her sex tape, Farrah Superstar: Backdoor Teen Mom) enlisted the help of third-generation matchmaker Patti Stanger for help finding a man.

Like almost every notable Australian star to have made the jump to Hollywood before her, Margot Robbie got her start in either Neighbours or Home and Away. Funnily enough, having played Donna Freedman in 353 episodes of the latter, she went off to America and instantly landed a plum supporting role as Leonardo DiCaprio’s wife in The Wolf of Wall Street.

They say you are never too far away from an Irish bar. In Milan, a 4km walk from the San Siro will bring you to Mulligans Pub.
That is where a group of Liverpool supporters headed to after their team’s 2-1 victory over AC Milan on December 7. They had just watched Divock Origi score the winner which helped wrap up a sixth Champions League group stage win.
It was in that memorabilia-stacked whiskey bar in central Milan where Diogo Jota’s new song first took off.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Emma Roberts Involved in Bilson, Christensen Split: Source</h2><time>Jun 1, 2024</time>

Emma Roberts was at the center of Rachel Bilson and Hayden Christensen’s split, a source confirms to Us Weekly.
According to The Blast, Bilson found text messages between Christensen and his Little Italy costar, which led the Hart of Dixie alum to believe that the two were having an inappropriate relationship.

<a href=../../../nvidia-forceware-257-heterogeneous-gpu-physx-its-a-bug-not-a-feature.html></a>
Our inbox quickly lit up this morning when we received notice about this NGOHQ article, discussing how NVIDIA had removed the heterogeneous GPU restriction on PhysX in their latest beta drivers. This struck us as a bit of an odd reversal of positions from NVIDIA, and now that we've had a chance to chat with them we finally know what's going on.
As a quick matter of background, starting with the Forceware 186 series NVIDIA blocked GPU/PPU-accelerated PhysX from working on NVIDIA GPUs and AGEIA PPUs whenever a non-NVIDIA GPU was detected as being in the system.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../post/page/83/>← Prev Page</a>
