Lately I have found myself doing a case review here and there, and battery cases are particularly interesting since they're easy enough for us to test and integrate into our workflow in a unique matter. Plus, there's never such thing as too much battery life for a device. Battery life is a big part of our smartphone reviews, and for a while now I've been carrying around the newly-released Mophie Juice Pack Helium case for the iPhone 5.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Thor: Ragnarok To Feature Marvel Studios First LGBT Character</h2><time>May 13, 2024</time>

In Norse mythology, Ragnarok (AKA&nbsp;Twilight of the Gods) is defined as the end of all things ‚Äì a great battle that leads to the death of several major figures, including Odin, Heimdall, and Loki. But in the Marvel Cinematic Universe,&nbsp;Ragnarok&nbsp;looks set to herald one of the most spectacular and indeed hilarious superhero movies of the past few years.

1993‚Äôs&nbsp;Super Mario Bros. is a notorious cinematic disaster, but if you want to revisit it, there‚Äôs now an extended cut available on the Internet Archive for free.
Recommended Videos Starring Bob Hoskins as Mario, John Leguizamo as Luigi and Dennis Hopper as Koopa, it‚Äôs considered a terribly conceived adaptation that reimagines the cute and cuddly game series as a hellish cyberpunk dystopia. The stories of its production have become legendary, from the stars spending the shoot getting extremely drunk together, renegade directorial team Rocky Morton and Annabel Jankel going way off-piste and Nintendo finding the whole experience so off-putting that they abandoned Hollywood for decades.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>ABC News' Rhiannon Ally: 5 Things To Know Amid 'GMA3' Scandal</h2><time>May 12, 2024</time>
