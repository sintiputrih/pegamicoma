Nelson</strong></a>) leaves her for a younger woman, Phyllis, a Beverly Hills socialite, must find something else to focus on. She decides to become the den mother to a group of Wilderness Girls in the area, including her daughter Hannah (<a href=#><strong>Jenny Lewis</strong></a>).</p><p>The girls include the daughters of some of the biggest names in Hollywood — a washed-up actor’s kid, a dictator’s baby girl and more. While <a href=#>leading the troop to get their patches</a> — the jewelry appraisal patch is one of the most memorable ones — she finds purpose and confidence in herself.</p><p>Phyllis, however, doesn’t do anything without making some noise, causing rival troop leader Velda Plendor (<strong>Betty Thomas</strong>) to send in a spy to try and sabotage the girls. Despite her best efforts, Phyllis and her band of rich misfits sell cookies in style, <a href=#>survive the muddy wilderness at the annual jamboree</a> and prove that there is more to life than wealth and winning.</p><p>Thirty years after the film made a splash with fans, some of the cast reunited to celebrate its staying power in March 2019.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Tori Spelling</strong></a>, who played Jamie, one of the rival Red Feathers troop girls, recalled learning from her den mother Thomas, despite her mean demeanor onscreen.</p><p>“Obviously, I had a small part, but I just loved watching,” she told <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a> at the time. “On set, [Betty] was definitely my mentor and I was taking everything in the comedy. I mean, we did everything.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Beverly Hills, 90210</a> alum added: “I had a great time. But it was the flip for me. I was coming from Beverly Hills, I grew up in Beverly Hills, then I was playing the opposite. We were from Culver City, which is super chic now, by the way.”</p><p>Long explained that while they were filming, she “knew it was special as we were doing it.” The <a href=#>Cheers</a> alum admitted you “never know how that’s going to translate” but the fact that everyone was “having a lot of fun” was a good sign.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Kellie Martin</strong></a>, who played Beverly Hills trooper Emily, said when she watched it back as an adult, she understood why fans still love it.</p><p>“I think it’s amazing that it holds up. I actually just watched the movie for the first time in a long time and I couldn’t believe how funny it was, because I didn’t get the jokes when I was 12 years old,” she said. “It was like watching it for the first time because I really got all the jokes and appreciated all these amazing performances. It was totally over my head.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>During <a href=#>the reunion at the Beverly Hills Hotel</a> — which was where the troop “camped out” early on in the film — the stars also addressed rumors of a movie reunion. “I think we should do it,” Thomas said, noting there has been a script at Sony for years. Long chimed in saying, “We could have some cameos!”</p><p>Scroll down to see what the cast of Troop Beverly Hills has been up to since selling cookies and singing campfire songs in the film.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2Bpv7C7z2aZnq6Vp7m6eceio6WrXZiutMCMsJ%2BeqpVirrOxjK2fnrFdo7y4ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pickled-carrots.html><span>←</span><span>Quick Pickled Carrots</span></a>
