This was before the internet so I would sit and read cookbooks for hours and be one happy girl about it.</p><p>After I was married, my friends would tease me because when I would go over to their house, I would ask to see their cookbooks, and precede to lay on the floor with a stack of cookbooks and just read as much as I could.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Classic-Chocolate-Chip-Cookies-4-scaled.jpg><p>But the first thing I would do when opening a cookbook was to look at their take on a chocolate chip cookie recipe. Most of them became a variation of the classic Nestle Tollhouse chocolate chip cookie. I wanted to switch things up!</p><p>So I created recipes like my <span><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Levain Bakery Chocolate Chip Cookies</strong></a></span> which has a unique baking temperature and different types and combinations of ingredients and they have become a hit!</p><p>I get readers asking me all of the time for just an easy, classic, simple chocolate chip cookie recipe. This is the recipe for you! I made a few changes to make them extra soft and chewy. I hope you love these classic chocolate chip cookies!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Classic-Chocolate-Chip-Cookies-11-1-scaled.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How to make the perfect Classic Chocolate Chip Cookies:</h2><ul><li><strong>Cream butter and sugars together for 4 minutes</strong>. This is an important step as it helps to adds pockets of air that aerate the batter and gift it loft when baked. This air puffs up the cookies as they bake, giving them a lighter texture. It also helps to ensure you don’t end up with grainy cookies! I love to use <span><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>my KitchenAid</strong></a></span> for all of my baking and you can find them <span><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>HERE</a></strong></span>.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Add eggs and vanilla</strong>. I use large eggs in all of my baking recipes and pure vanilla extract. I love to use</li></ul><a class=easyazon-link data-cart=y data-cloak=y data-identifier=B000GAWH4G data-locale=US data-localize=y data-popups=y data-tag=modehone-20 href=# rel=nofollow><span><strong>Nielsen-Massey Vanilla</strong></span></a><p>or this</p><a class=easyazon-link data-cart=y data-cloak=y data-identifier=B0013ABIXY data-locale=US data-localize=y data-popups=y data-tag=modehone-20 href=# rel=nofollow><span><strong>Mexican vanilla</strong></span></a><p>.&nbsp;</p><li><strong>Fold in flour, cornstarch, baking soda, and salt</strong>. The baking soda gives the cookies a nice rise and the cornstarch helps to keep them nice and soft — even days later.&nbsp;</li><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Classic-Chocolate-Chip-Cookies-13-scaled.jpg><ul><li><strong>Fold in your favorite type of chopped chocolate bars</strong>. You can use chocolate chips or chocolate bars. The reason I love to use chocolate bars in my cookies is that they melt beautifully. Chocolate chips are made to keep their shape but sometimes you want some ooey gooey melted chocolate throughout your cookies. I always have at least four Trader Joe’s Pound Plus Bars in my kitchen in both Dark Chocolate and Milk Chocolate.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>If you want to take an extra step to make your cookies even better, CHILL the dough</strong>. Roll into balls and then cover well and place in the refrigerator to chill. It is best to chill for 24 hours, if you can wait that long! I have tested cookie dough and the cookies get even better if you let it chill for 36-48 hours.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Bake on light-colored baking sheets</strong>.</li></ul><a class=easyazon-link data-cart=y data-cloak=y data-identifier=B0049C2S32 data-locale=US data-localize=y data-popups=y data-tag=modehone-20 href=# rel=nofollow><span><strong>These baking sheets</strong></span></a><p>are my favorite and will last you forever!
