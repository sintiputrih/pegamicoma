This will be the tenth season of the show, coming just months after the last.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=262 data-current-count=262 data-injectable=false>After so long the Love Island formula is getting a bit predictable, so fortunately the show is set to shake things up with a mysterious twist right off the bat. The show’s creative director Mike Spencer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">spoke to The Sun</a> and teased some big changes, saying:</p><p>“It’s down to us as producers to switch up the format, keep it fresh and keep viewers on their toes. I think you can tune in on episode one and there are a few things you weren’t expecting.”</p><p data-characters=300 data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>But exactly what that’ll be remains a mystery. One new development that’s already been confirmed is that the public will get to play Cupid even before the show begins by pairing up couples via the official app, the results of which should be unveiled in the opening episode. Spencer said:</p><p>“We know the public are going to couple up the islanders, but I think from the get-go the start of the show might be different.”&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=94 data-current-count=94 data-injectable=false>This isn’t the twist though, which seems to be something that we won’t see coming:</p><p>“On the first day as well – I hope viewers will be gobsmacked. It’s [bringing] twists on traditional formats and keeping islanders on their toes, because it can be predictable. … &nbsp;expect the unexpected, that’s all I’ll say.”</p><p data-characters=507 data-current-count=855 data-injectable=true>We await with bated breath to see what they’ve cooked up and how these contestants will respond to it. All of them will be seasoned Love Island viewers going in, so they’ll be feeling confident they know what’s coming and will have their own game plans that’ll see them through to victory. However, if the formula really is being seriously shaken up all that planning will go out the window and they’ll have to think fast to avoid being the first person dumped out of the show.</p><p data-characters=86 data-current-count=86 data-injectable=false>Whatever else happens it’s going to be an interesting summer in the villa…</p><p data-characters=40 data-current-count=126 data-injectable=false>Love Island season ten begins on June 5.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y1tMRmo6iulWK2tLjAp5tmrJWWum6t0Z5kqaqfora0tc2gZJ2qkaKutbXCZquwoaOpwG61zWaroZ1dm7azv9NmnKmho6Sxpns%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./suzanne-somers-kathleen-turner-gift-serial-mom-set.html><span>←</span><span>Suzanne Somers Gave 'Serial Mom' Costar Kathleen Turner a Hilarious Gift</span></a>
