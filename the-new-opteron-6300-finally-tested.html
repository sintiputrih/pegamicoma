In contrast, SPECint_Rate2006 improved by only 8%, and SPECfp_Rate2006 by 7%. However, it is important to note that SPECCPU2006 rates do not scale well with clockspeed. For example an 8% clockspeed (<a href=#>6380</a> vs <a href=#>6376</a>) only results in a 3.5% higher SPECint_Rate2006 and a 3% <a href=#>higher</a> SPECfp_Rate2006. And the SPEC CPU 2006 benchmarks were showing the Interlagos Opteron at its best anyway. You can read our <a href=#>analysis here</a>.</p><p>Both benchmarks have only a distant link to real server workloads, and we could conclude only two things. Firstly, performance per GHz has improved and power consumption has gone down. Secondly, we are only sure that this is the case with well optimized, even completely recompiled code. The compiler setting of SPEC CPU 2006, the JVM settings of Specjbb: it is all code that does not exist on servers which are running real applications.</p><p>So is the new Opteron "Abu Dhabi" a few percent faster or is it tangibly faster when running real world code? And are the power consumption gains marginal at best or measureable? Well, most of our benchmarks are real world, so we will find out over the next several pages as we offer our full review of the Opteron 6300.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZIN2fJdoq6GdXaOyuHnOqaueqp%2Bjend%2Fj2lkn6GelrmtxYytnKyslZk%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pumpkin-spiced-corn-muffins.html><span>←</span><span>Pumpkin Spiced Corn Muffins</span></a>
