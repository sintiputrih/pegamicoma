As such he must have been born in the year 1994, but his exact date of birth is not known. Currently, as he is under investigation, Police are letting out only very little information about him. Since his exact date of birth is not known his Sun sign or Zodiac sign can’t be predicted. Bryan might have been born and brought up in Albrightsville, Pennsylvania, United States as his parent’s home is located there.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Bryan_Christopher_Kohberger_Parents_Siblings_Education></span><strong>Bryan Christopher Kohberger Parents, Siblings, Education</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Christopher was born to Parents who probably lived in the United States.&nbsp; As per the investigation details, Bryan was arrested from his parent’s home in Albrightsville, Pennsylvania, United States. The name of his parents or siblings is not known at the moment. Bryan must have finished his schooling at a local high school in his hometown, Pennsylvania. However, it appears that he has pursued higher studies at Washington State University and is a Ph.D. in Criminal Justice and Criminology.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wikibiography.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Untitled-design-2022-12-31T142453.152-300x225.jpg.webp><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Bryan_Christopher_Kohberger_Career_Personality></span><strong>Bryan Christopher Kohberger Career, Personality</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Bryan Christopher is a Ph.D. student in Criminology. As such he is highly knowledgeable in his subject. He used to work as an Assistant instructor for 3 undergraduate criminal courses at Washington State University, his Alma Mater. When newspapers and websites started mentioning him as the suspect linked with University of Idaho student murders, several of his colleagues and students commented on him and we can understand his personality from the same.</p><p>One of his students commented that he appeared to be confident and outgoing, but at the same time quite awkward. He also aimed to appear as a clever person. Bryan also had the habit of explaining everything in the most complicated way. His students claim that it was his tactic to let them know that he knows a lot. One of his friends, Schyler Jacobson said that he was in complete shock as Bryan was his friend and used to go on night runs with him and he couldn’t believe that he could do such a thing.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Bryan_Christopher_Kohberger_Idaho_Student_Murders_Investigation></span><strong>Bryan Christopher Kohberger Idaho Student Murders, Investigation</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>On 13 November 2022 four students from the University of Idaho were murdered or stabbed to death. The students were Kaylee Goncalves, Madison Mogen, Xana Kernodle, and Ethan Chapin. The Police and FBI started investigating the issue for a long time. They had a big break in the investigation when through some public sources they came to know that a white Hyundai Elantra car was spotted in front of the house of the victims. The Police said that an Elantra has been discovered but the Murder Weapon is not known. Police traced back to Kohberger from the DNA traces in the Victim’s body and he was arrested from his parent’s home in Albrightsville, Pennsylvania, United States, and was accused of first-degree murder and felony burglary.</p><p>He previously had no arrest records, except that one time when he was mentioned by the Police for not wearing a seatbelt. In the Post-Mortem reports of the students, they were found to have injuries developed from stabbing. The students were from the University of Idaho and lived in the city of Moscow, Northern Idaho. Some of the students might have tried to fight back and had defensive injuries. The victims were attacked when they were asleep according to experts, but there are no traces of any sexual assault involved. Bryan is currently held in custody at Monroe County Correctional Facility. He has already appeared before the Monroe County judge and was remanded in custody without bail. The Police have not revealed anything about the motive behind the killings, due to privacy measures. We will update you once we have any information.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wikibiography.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Untitled-design-2022-12-31T142538.689-300x225.jpg.webp><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Bryan_Christopher_Kohberger_Girlfriend_Relationships></span><strong>Bryan Christopher Kohberger Girlfriend, Relationships</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Bryan Christopher has dedicated most of his time to educating himself as is evident from his Ph.D. degree in Criminology and Criminal Justice. He must have been interested in the subject so much so as to pursue a doctorate degree. After his reveal as the suspect behind Idaho student murders, many of his friends and acquaintances have come up and talked about his personality. However, nobody ever mentioned him having a girlfriend. It appears that he had a disturbed mind and didn’t have any romantic relationships. As of now, his sexuality is also not known.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Bryan_Christopher_Kohberger_Height_Weight_Nationality_Arrest></span><strong>Bryan Christopher Kohberger Height, Weight, Nationality, Arrest</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Bryan appears to be quite tall like 5 feet 11, but his exact measures are not available. He didn’t appear to be overweight or underweight and so we can conclude that he had a balanced weight. Since he was born and brought up in the United States, he has an American Nationality. He was arrested in link to the University of Idaho student Murders on 30th December 2022. The cold-blooded murder of young adults from the University of Idaho has shaken the people to the core. The Police and FBI worked closely with the public and through various clues and guesses traced back to Christopher. He had green eyes and dark brown hair and hs very sharp facial features.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto
