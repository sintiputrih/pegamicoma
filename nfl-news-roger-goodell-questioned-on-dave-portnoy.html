<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Politicians are SNL skits come to life: Rep Jim Jordan gets ridiculed on Twitter for calling B</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>The NFL’s time is not right, the league has been facing a barrage of lawsuits, ranging from the Cleveland Browns situation in which quarterback Deshaun Watson faces multiple accusations of sexual misconduct and inappropriate behavior to the Jon Gruden lawsuit wherein former Raiders HC has filed a lawsuit against the league claiming that it intentionally leaked emails and attempted to destroy his career on purpose. The league faced a setback when it attempted to shut the suit down by getting it dismissed but the courts denied such an appeal. Then there is the cherry on top, the lawsuit filed by former Miami Dolphins HC Brian Flores who is suing the league and all 32 teams for racial discrimination in hiring practices.</p><p>The case in question today is the ongoing investigation into the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Washington Commanders </a>organization. The league has been investigating the workplace of the team as women working there have described the environment there as toxic and filled with rampant sexual harassment. The team owner <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Daniel Snyder</a> himself is in a ton of trouble as he has been accused of misbehaving with women on numerous occasions and now along with the league, a Congressional committee has also begun to look into the owner and the team. The league commissioner was also invited to testify in front of Congress which he accepted as opposed to Daniel Snyder who denied appearing before them.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p><strong>Also Read:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">James Jones makes a bold prediction on 49ers QB Trey Lance; compares him with Aaron Rodgers and Patrick Mahomes</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>“I’m not familiar with that issue”: Roger Goodell on Dave Portnoy being banned from attending NFL games</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Adobe_Express_20220623_2048150-1024x576.jpg><p><a href=#>Roger Goodell</a> has been accused of silencing his critics on numerous occasions, the one that stands out prominently is Dave Portnoy, the founder of Barstool Sports. Dave was banned from attending NFL games in 2015, technically his company was after they staged a protest at the NFL headquarters following the suspension of Tom Brady over the infamous ‘Deflategate’ scandal. To make matters worse, the Commissioner had Portnoy removed from Super Bowl LIII in February of 2019.</p><p>NFL in 2020 in an attempt to do its part towards donating to COVID-19 relief efforts during the 2020 NFL draft put up an auction bid, the winner of which would get a chance to sit down and watch a game with Commissioner Roger Goodell. Dave Portnoy won that by paying $250,000 yet he never got a chance to do so as the league claimed he failed a background check.</p><p>During the course of the hearings before the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Reform, Commissioner Goodell responded to Rep. Jim Jordan, a Republican statesman from Ohio’s question regarding Portnoy.</p><p>“Why did you ban Dave Portnoy from NFL games?” the representative asked, the Commissioner responds by stating, “Congressman, I am not familiar with that issue, I’m happy to check with my staff, but I’m not aware of that.” Rep. Jim Jordan condescendingly responds by stating, ” Really, I think we’re all aware of that.”</p><p>Rep. Jim Jordan received a lot of flak for his question which appeared to be irrelevant in this situation and moreover the Commissioner also received some backlash as there was no way he could have been kept in the dark about this. Take a look at how NFL fans reacted to this question.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Because no one else is familiar with the issue or even cares about it.</p><p>But thank God a Congressman does care about a press pass status for a football game.</p>— Stef Fanski 🇺🇦 (@Oh__Cleveland) <a href=#>June 22, 2022</a></figure><p>Free Press is important after all right?
