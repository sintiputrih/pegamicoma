It is quickly becoming one of my most ordered foods at restaurants. This Slow Roasted Beef and Sweet Potato Hash is comfort food in a bowl!</p><p>I won’t even divulge how many times I traveled to Utah in 2019 because it is excessive. 🙂 Between moving my daughter several times to attending two weddings to attending a food conference for work, you can just say that I was a frequent visitor to the great state of Utah. So when I go there, I want to find the unique restaurants I can’t get in Arizona.&nbsp;</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Braised-Beef-and-Sweet-Potato-Hash-Bowl-5-scaled.jpg alt="Braised Beef and Sweet Potato Hash Bowl.

We found a cozy place called Vessel Kitchen, which serves farm fresh food in a casual setting. I was hooked as soon as I walked in the door! I wanted to try every single one of their vegetable dishes because they looked phenomenal. We ordered a bunch of different items and just shared and we loved all of them.</p><p>However, there was one standout — the Hash Hash Bowl. It was <strong>braised beef, sweet potato hash, feta cheese, pickled onions, horseradish aioli, and fresh parsley</strong>. Oh my goodness, I couldn’t get it in my mouth fast enough! The flavors were off the charts.</p><p>So I decided it was imperative to re-create it at home so I can eat it anytime I want! But you better believe when we go visit Utah in February to snowboard and see our college girl, we are visiting Park City just to eat those bowls again!</p><p>A little side note — we loved their stainless steel cups so much that we called the restaurant and talked to the manager to find out where they bought them. Lucky for us, they purchased them from Amazon and we bought the pack of 12 since they were so much less expensive that way..

I usually pick up a chuck roast from the grocery store, place it in my slow cooker, sprinkle on some seasonings, and let it slowly cook for about 8 hours. When you wake up in the morning, just place the roast in a crockpot, set it, and you are halfway there! If you need a <a class=easyazon-link data-cart=y data-cloak=y data-identifier=B004P2NG0K data-locale=US data-localize=y data-popups=y data-tag=modehone-20 href=# rel=nofollow><strong>new crockpot — here’s the one I use</strong></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The sweet potato hash can be made by peeling and cutting sweet potatoes into small pieces. You can also buy them pre-cut at the grocery store in the produce section. Then dice up a sweet onion into small pieces and place on a baking sheet. Drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and salt. It’s that simple! Bake at 425 degrees for about 25-35 minutes. You want the sweet potatoes to be soft and completely cooked through!&nbsp;</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Braised-Beef-and-Sweet-Potato-Hash-Bowl-8-scaled.jpg alt="Braised Beef and Sweet Potato Hash Bowl.

You can either make a homemade horseradish aioli or pick up a creamy horseradish sauce at the grocery store. &nbsp;A little goes a long way but horseradish is known to be a perfect accompaniment to beef. If you aren’t a fan of horseradish, you don’t even have to use it!&nbsp;</p><p>Once the beef is fully cooked and tender, shred into pieces and check for seasonings. Place the sweet potato hash in a bowl. Top with the shredded braised beef. Sprinkle feta cheese on the top. Drizzle with a touch of horseradish aioli and garnish with fresh parsley. &nbsp;It is such a comforting meal, perfect for these cold January nights.&nbsp;</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Braised-Beef-Sweet-Potato-Hash-Recipe.png alt="Braised Beef and Sweet Potato Hash Bowl.
