Although her face was not seen in the video, which was shot at a party in a St. Louis hotel room, when a photo from the event appeared online, she was wearing the same outfit she had on in the video, according to the paper.</p><p>“I was in like maybe four minutes of the entire thing, and I definitely did not think this would be the thing that would ruin my entire career,” Gaither told the Post-Dispatch.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Coppage has reportedly raked in close to $1 million selling porn after her story made international headlines. <span class=credit>Brianna Coppage/Instagram</span></figure><p>She said a student slipped a note under her classroom door suggesting they “knew her secret.”</p><p>Gaither and Coppage told the paper they didn’t know they were both on OnlyFans until June, when Gaither made an offhand remark at a “Teachers Night” at Busch Stadium.</p><p>On Friday, Gaither described Coppage as her best friend.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Brianna Coppage was suspended on September 27. <span class=credit>St. Clair School District</span></figure><p>She said the district put her on leave because of “professionalism and student communication,” though she insists she has never acted unprofessionally and had earned good reviews from school officials.</p><p>Gaither, who has master’s degrees from Missouri Baptist University and Arizona State University, said she still loves teaching but that her “career at St. Clair is over regardless of what I do.”</p><p>“I legitimately have love in my heart for each and every one of (my students),” she told the Post-Dispatch. “The students are why I told myself I would spend 30 years of my life at that school, and I feel like I am abandoning them. I know I will likely never see them again.”</p><p>School Superintendent Kyle Kruse told the outlet that the “district does not have a statement to issue at this time.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Gaither says she was put on leave Friday after her X-rated moonlighting job was revealed. <span class=credit>Google Maps</span></figure><p>Gaither said she and her husband have already talked about moving and that she would likely reactivate her OnlyFans account.</p><p>“Right now, I am just hoping to make enough to support my family,” she told the paper, adding that she suspects other teachers have turned to the adult site to bolster their income.</p><p>“I wouldn’t be surprised if there are other teachers out there (in Missouri),” Gaither said. “Teachers are probably freaking out right now because two teachers from the same school, in less than a month, have been caught.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGlmbGhfo7K4v46tnJqbmJq%2FbrnEoJinZZeWtrW0xKtkqa2kYryvecuemK%2BdXZaztbHRZpqarZedwW67zWamp6Spm66vv44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./t-j-holmes-had-concerns-about-airing-amy-robach-fight-due-to-race.html><span>←</span><span>T.J.
