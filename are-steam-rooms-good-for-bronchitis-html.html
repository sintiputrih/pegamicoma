 Answer
In general, bronchitis should be treated the same way you would a cold: with rest, plenty of water, and acetaminophen for pain relief. Phlegm may be alleviated by inhaling steam from a vaporizer or a bowl of hot water, or by having a hot shower. Cough suppressants that are available over-the-counter may help you get through the day and sleep through the night."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
