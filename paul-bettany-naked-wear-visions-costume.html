It’s certainly not a fun thing to go through, and when asked in a recent interview if he’d rather be naked for the rest of his life or dress only as his MCU character, his response was swift and definitive.</p><p>“I would really, can I ask, can I choose where I’m naked or am I just naked guy? I’m gonna pick that. I’m gonna pick naked. It’s pretty uncomfortable in the Vision outfit. I might not die of heat exhaustion.”</p><p data-characters=384 data-current-count=384 data-injectable=false>As a purple synthezoid powered by an Infinity Stone, a lengthy stint in the makeup chair was always going to be required to convincingly depict Vision in live-action, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">but based on the footage we’ve seen so far</a> from <strong>WandaVision</strong>, it appears that Bettany gets the opportunity to go au naturel for the majority of the sitcom-influenced sequences, which must have been a huge relief.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yxrdSlZJudpKmur8WMp5iknZRixKat0WatoquZpLu0ecKoqq2tnZp8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./new-restaurant-tax-for-ralston-arena-goes-into-effect.html><span>←</span><span>New Restaurant Tax For Ralston Arena Goes Into Effect</span></a>
