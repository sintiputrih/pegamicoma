While active, Flair had multiple streams of income aside from pro wrestling; he earned from pay-per-view attractions, brand promotions, and public appearances.</p><p data-characters=371 data-current-count=763 data-injectable=true>However, Ric Flair’s current net worth as reported by Celebrity Net Worth is pegged at a meager $500,000. This is quite a shocking downturn, especially for someone who hosted Starrcade ten times. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Flair himself also once appeared on The Breakfast Club</a> and confessed he once made $800,000 a year in two separate years. So what happened to Ric Flair and all his money?</p><h2 data-injectable=false>How did Ric Flair lose his money?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Ric Flair® Nature Boy® (@ricflairnatureboy)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=553 data-current-count=853 data-injectable=true>In a classic tale of overspending, Ric Flair spent exorbitant amounts on custom-made suits, jewelry, dining out, and flashy robes to maintain his image. His robe budget alone was astronomical – he once spent $40,000 on a single robe just because he liked it. Beyond the basic costs of living, however, Flair spent at least $14,000 on Christmas gifts, and $200,000 on jewelry annually. He also owned numerous expensive cars, despite having little to no need for them. Altogether, his extravagant spending on non-essentials drained his bank account.</p><p data-characters=524 data-current-count=524 data-injectable=true>As if his spendthrift lifestyle was not enough, Ric Flair also lacked financial planning and foresight. He made terrible investment decisions by pouring money into various shady schemes and businesses, without doing due diligence. For example, there was Ric Flair Finance, an illegal enterprise he invested heavily in just because his name was attached. As a result, he lost significant money when the operation was shut down. Flair also took out loans he could not repay, resulting in a slew of lawsuits and defaults.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=362 data-current-count=362 data-injectable=false>Moving on to Ric Flair’s tax issues, which made headlines for the better part of two decades. These started as far back as the early 1990s, and went on until 2018. The&nbsp; IRS seized his earnings multiple times, delivering huge blows to his net worth. Subsequently, Ric Flair had to take loans from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vince McMahon</a>, just to pay off some of his tax debts.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=424 data-current-count=786 data-injectable=true>On the romance front, Ric Flair wasn’t doing so well either, which added more blows to his fortune. Five expensive divorces further drained Flair’s bank account over the years. He spent significant sums on alimony, asset splits, lawyers, and other divorce-related costs. And as if these weren’t enough, Flair developed a heart condition in 2019 that set him back $1.9 million with no health insurance coverage.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>So where is Ric Flair now?</h2><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by Ric Flair® Nature Boy® (@ricflairnatureboy)</a></p><p data-characters=1 data-current-count=1 data-injectable=false></p><p data-characters=623 data-current-count=624 data-injectable=false>Believe it or not, Ric Flair never stays down for too long! He recently signed a multi-year deal with AEW, although his exact on-screen role is unclear. He has also expressed his desire to manage Andrade El Idolo, his son-in-law, who is still signed with CJ Perry. Moreover, Flair’s Wooooo! Energy drink sponsors AEW, and he has other business ventures, including a virtual restaurant chain and a marijuana product line. Aside from these, Flair supplements his income through sponsorship deals, merchandise, and appearances. Indeed, his bank account isn’t what it used to be, but it’s going back up, bit by bit.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S%2Fqq%2BMn6OaoaKoeq%2Bx02auqKqknXqku82foKullZl8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jimmy-kimmel-live.html><span>←</span><span>Jimmy Kimmel Live News - Us Weekly</span></a>
