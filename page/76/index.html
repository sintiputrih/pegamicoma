One of my favorite things to do in the summer is visit farmer’s markets…..and we have done that all over the country. We love taste testing farm fresh products and picking up handpicked fruits and veggies.

Although its taste is unbeatable, bacon is not traditionally your best choice for a protein because it's high in fat, calories, sodium and nitrates.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Who Is Paul McCartney's Wife, Nancy Shevell?</h2><time>Jun 16, 2024</time>
