Still in his 20’s, he built the&nbsp;foundation&nbsp;of a fanbase, has been developing his show for 15 years, and is now positioned as one of&nbsp;country&nbsp;music’s&nbsp;next breakout artists&nbsp;nationwide.&nbsp; Drawing inspiration from The Eagles, Keith Richards, Turnpike Troubadours and more, Kent strives to build an undeniable stage presence and his bandana-wearing Rock ‘N’ Roll spirit comes to life on the stage.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2020, Corey released his&nbsp;From the West LP&nbsp;which garnered 3.5+ million aggregate streams and set the stage for his next chapter. His song “Gold” and fan favorite “Ain’t My Day” has nearly 15 million streams combined.

Originally from New Braunfels, Texas, Offerman grew up on a horse ranch. Home schooled by her father in the tack room of their barn, she gravitated towards music at a young age. Offerman started playing piano at the age of four which eventually led her to pursue other instruments such as violin, accordion and more. When she was 11, Offerman’s accordion teacher asked her to join their polka band where they traveled across Texas performing. &nbsp;Offerman graduated from Berklee College of Music at the age of 19 and signed her publishing deal with Universal Music Group Publishing about five years later. Offerman was featured in The Highwomen’s “Redesigning Women” video, inked her record deal with Universal Music Group in 2020 and was named one of “The Boot’s” 2021 Artists to Watch. Her debut track “Happyland Trailer Park” was released earlier this year.

To make ends meet, he spent tireless hours working construction jobs, but never lost sight of his own dream to make music. A chance encounter with Jake Owen in 2017 led to a collaborative friendship and an opening slot on the road. Shortly thereafter, Fleet was sharing the stage with one of his heroes – Willie Nelson – and etching his mark in the Nashville songwriting community, co-writing with esteemed tunesmiths Rhett Akins, Brett James, and Kendell Marvel. The hard-working family man is turning heads now with full-length album, Stack of Records (Big Loud Records), produced by Joey Moi, the follow up to his aptly titled first project, Workin’ Hard. Breakout hit “Where I Find God” – a powerful ode to finding peace in a higher power’s presence – is featured on the new set, garnering Fleet praise for his “emotive vocals” (Billboard) and amassing over 27 million official music video views. Fleet just wrapped a run supporting Morgan Wallen’s Dangerous Tour and is on the road now on his first-ever headlining One For The Road Tour.</p><p><strong>Contact info:</strong></p><p>Jess Anderson<br><a href=#><span class=__cf_email__ data-cfemail=117b746262517378767d7e64753f727e7c>[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a></p><p><strong>About Live Nation Entertainment:</strong></p><p>Live Nation Entertainment (NYSE: LYV) is the world’s leading live entertainment company comprised of global market leaders: Ticketmaster, Live Nation Concerts, and Live Nation Sponsorship.
