The film has received praise from fans and critics. And today, we will be talking about the actor, <strong>Yoson An,</strong> who portrayed <i>Chen Honghui</i> in Mulan.</p><p>Yoson An is a famous Macanese-New Zealander filmmaker and actor. He has been active in the industry since 2012.</p><h2>Bio</h2><p>Yoson An was born on <i>June 23, 1992,</i> in <i>Portuguese Macau. </i>At 7, he moved to Auckland, New Zealand, along with his parents and three younger sisters.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2021/1/18/nith-1610947377262.JPG><p>Yoson speaks fluent Cantonese and Mandarin. He graduated from <i>Saint Kentigern College</i>. While at school, he studied music and participated in theatre.</p><p>An practices kickboxing, ninjutsu, powerlifting, and Olympic weightlifting. Do you know An is a black belt in Karate?</p><h2>Yoson An Relationship Status</h2><p>The 6 feet tall actor has made an image of a handsome man among his female audiences. No doubt, fans are curious to know about his love life. Yoson is currently single, but in the past, he was in a relationship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/9/9/An-1599642052389.jpg><p>The actor once mentioned that he dated his Taiwanese girlfriend. He also said she guided him on mastering Mandarin, which later helped him get jobs.

One of the biggest changes in the new movie is Mulan's love interest, Chen Honghui.</p><p><i><strong>Watch Yoson talking about his character in Mulan!</strong></i></p><figure class=media></figure><p>In the old animated film, Mulan, played by <a href=#><strong>Liu Yifei</strong></a><strong>,</strong> falls in love with her commanding officer, Li Shang. However, this time Honghui replaces Shang's character. Luckily for Yoson, he received love from both viewers and critics.</p><h3>Why Yoson waited for two years?</h3><p>While Yoson might have wooed the audiences from his performance in Mulan, but he waited almost two years to star in the film. In an interview, the actor <a href=# rel=nofollow><strong>revealed</strong></a> he sent the audition tape for Honghui in <i>2016 </i>but didn't hear the good news until almost <i>2018</i>.</p><h2>Net Worth</h2><p>Yoson An has an estimated net worth of <strong>$500,000</strong> as of early <i>2021</i>.
