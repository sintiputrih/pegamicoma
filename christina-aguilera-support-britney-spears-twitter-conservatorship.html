Among her sentiments shared during a nearly 30-minute court address, Spears expressed her frustration at the lack of compassion from those spearheading and enabling the conservatorship, noting the particularly disheartening psychological and emotional abuse she's endured. In Aguilera's note shared on social media, the "Fighter" singer included a throwback photo of the two from their time on the hit Disney show.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"These past few days I've been thinking about Britney and everything she is going through," Aguilera tweeted. "It is unacceptable that any woman, or human, wanting to be in control of their own destiny might not be allowed to live life as they wish.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"To be silenced, ignored, bullied or denied support by those 'close' to you is the most depleting, devastating and demeaning thing imaginable," Aguilera continued. "The harmful mental and emotional damage this can take on a human spirit is nothing to be taken lightly. Every woman must have the right to her own body, her own reproductive system, her own privacy, her own space, her own healing and her own happiness."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Aguilera added, "While I am not behind the closed doors of this very layered & personal yet public conversation - all I can do is share from my heart on what I've heard, read and seen in the media. The conviction and desperation of this plea for freedom leads me to believe that this person I once knew has been living without compassion or decency from those in control.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"To a woman who has worked under conditions and pressure unimaginable to most, I promise you she deserves all of the freedom possible to live her happiest life. My heart goes out to Britney. She deserves all the TRUE love and support in the world," she concluded.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Other celebrities including <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a36826259/justin-timberlake-shows-support-of-britneys-court-address/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Justin Timberlake" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Justin Timberlake</a> additionally spoke out in public support of Spears. Last week, Timberlake took to Twitter to share his own feelings about Spears's conservatorship and what she's been going through. "Regardless of our past, good and bad, and no matter how long ago it was… what's happening to her is just not right. No woman should ever be restricted from making decisions about her own body," he shared on Twitter.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The much-anticipated virtual <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a36816629/britney-spears-speaks-about-conservatorship-at-hearing/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="conservatorship hearing" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">conservatorship hearing</a> took place on June 23, during which Spears addressed her concerns directly for the first time.
