Seth made the majority of his money from his adult entertainment business, called, Internet Entertainment Group (IEG).</p><p>The money he made over the year before his company shut down was real enough to rank as one of the biggest celebrity cashouts of all time. The majority of his income comes from being a successful Internet pornographer.</p><p>Warshavsky&nbsp;claims&nbsp;that IEG made US$50 million in 1997, which was not bad for a 3-year-old business owned by a 25-year-old high-school dropout.</p><p>His company first launched phonesex, which quickly grew to receive over fifty calls per day at a&nbsp;cost&nbsp;of $39.95 per call. Seth’s company’s annual revenues reportedly reached $60 million by 1995, after he bought out his partner.</p><p>He also ran an adult entertainment website called Club love through the company. The website featured live streams of adult entertainers.</p><p>And the customers would pay a website membership fee plus an hourly fee to view the online streams.</p><p>Warshavsky was named one of the 50 original internet pioneers on the front page of the Wall Street Journal and in Time Magazine.</p><p>However, the young dot-com entrepreneur got himself into a lot of trouble and was involved in a number of legal squabbles. Including the Pam and Tommy honeymoon video.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-seth-warshavsky-in-prison-now></span>Is Seth Warshavsky In Prison Now?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>No, Seth Warshavsky is not in prison now. However, the couple had sued him for allegedly making the private matters public.</p><p>A judge eventually granted Lee and Anderson a $1.5 million judgment against IEG, but by that time, the tape had already gone viral.</p><p>The celebrity couple later sold the rights of their video to IEG.</p><p>But they were unaware that this would result in their private video being available online as well as in stores on DVD and VHS, because of a deal Seth made.</p><p>Despite being sued, he was not arrested, possibly due to a lack of evidence or because he fled the United States.</p><p>You will get to learn more about him in a miniseries, Pam and Tommy, where,&nbsp;Fred Hechinger&nbsp;will portray his character.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=where-is-seth-warshavskytoday></span>Where Is Seth WarshavskyToday?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Seth Warshavsky is reported to have fled to Thailand after he was&nbsp;sued&nbsp;by Pam and Tommy. As they were not the only ones to file a case against him and the businessman appeared to be aware that he might be in trouble.</p><p>He was also involved in another case involving Hasbro, a massive conglomerate. Warshavsky, endowed with the audacity to embarrass celebrities and the legal clout to go to court, puts Hollywood on edge.</p><p>Most notably, actor Kelsey Grammer had also anonymously filed a lawsuit to keep a compromising home video of her off the internet.</p><p>According to reports, Seth fled the United States in January 2001 for Bangkok, Thailand, where he is still believed to be living.</p><p>He is reported to work in the telecommunications industry after running off from the US.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKuVqbVuw8CrqqGZpqi4unnNnqtmr5%2Bnwal5zJqlZq%2BYpHqisMOem2afkai8rbXNnmSopl2XwrO6yKeeZquTlrulrctmpp9loJa6bq3NnWStp52ixm5%2Bjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mary-barra-net-worth-2024.html><span>←</span><span>Mary Barra Net Worth 2024</span></a>
