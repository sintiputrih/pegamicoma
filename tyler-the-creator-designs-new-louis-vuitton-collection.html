The “Earfquake” singer has two clothing lines of his own; the streetwear brand Golf Wang, and Golf Le Fleur, its high-end counterpart.</p><p>When it came to designing the capsule collection with Louis Vuitton, Tyler ensured that it accurately reflected his own personal style. He even added an extra personal touch by hand drawing the Louis Vuitton monogram.</p><p>“My main focus was making things I would wear all the time. I dress the same in a meeting as I do a performance or grocery store trip, so hand drawing the monogram felt like the perfect balance to me,” Tyler told GQ in the same article.
