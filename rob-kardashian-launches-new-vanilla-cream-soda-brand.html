In October 2020, Kardashian announced the arrival of his Grandeza Hot Sauce <a href=#>via Instagram</a>. He partnered on the project with his mother, <a href=#><strong>Kris Jenner</strong></a>, and fashion designer, <strong>Nick Tershay</strong>.</p><p>“Created by an award winning chef, Grandeza hot sauce combines light tangy flavors with a touch of spice,” a description on t<a href=#>he company’s website</a> reads. “Great for balancing rich meals or to simply add another dimension of flavor.”</p><p>According to Grandeza Hot Sauce’s website, the product is sold online in a two-pack for $11.99 and is both vegan and gluten-free. Customers can also shop the brand’s apparel line, which includes T-shirts and hoodies.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Rob-Kardashian-Is-Launching-New-Vanilla-Cream-Soda-After-Unveiling-His-Hot-Sauce-Brand.jpg><p>The California native is no stranger to business. After graduating from the University of Southern California’s Marshall School of Business in 2009, he launched his own designer sock line in 2012 called Arthur George.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Kardashian previously explained how hands-on he was with his sock brand. “I have full control, though. I make sure to go to the factory, meet everybody, and to our warehouses here,” he told <a href=#>Racked</a> in 2012. “I want to know what’s going on. It’s hard, but it’s good because it’s what I want to do and it’s my thing.”</p><p>In addition to <a href=#>expanding his business empire</a> in 2021, Kardashian has continued to focus on raising his 4-year-old daughter, <a href=#>Dream</a>. After Thanksgiving in November 2020, the entrepreneur wrote via Instagram <a href=#>how he is “thankful every day” for his little one</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmn6efmXyvsdasZqunkmK4or7DmqqhoZGjeq2t1KeaoZ2jYrumw4yvmKehnKGubq%2FRnpimZaOksaJ5wauYp5xf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-beguiled-sofia-coppola-interview-html.html><span>←</span><span>How Sofia Coppola Reclaimed The Beguiled for Women (and Gay Men)</span></a>
