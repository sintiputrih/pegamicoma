<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Natalya Gives Strange Explanation After No-Selling Liv Morgans Finisher At WWE Live Event</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Liv Morgan hasn’t had a chance to defend her newly won SmackDown Women’s Championship on television just yet. After shocking everyone by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">cashing in her Money in the Bank briefcase</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">defeating Ronda Rousey</a>, Liv has been defending the title on the house show circuit. One of her recent opponents has been Natalya.</p><p>After Liv defeated Nattie with her finish at a recent WWE live event, a fan video went viral. The clip showed Natalya getting up immediately after eating the pin. Many jumped to the conclusion that something went wrong.</p><p>Natalya has always been known as a consummate professional between the ropes. It didn’t make much sense for her to disrespect an opponent, especially at the start of a long-awaited title reign. There were reports that Natalya did the same thing at another show in Reno, Nevada on Sunday. Nattie responded to a news outlet who reported on the incident before deleting it.</p><p>“I’m breaking character right now, but I actually said THANKYOU. If you must know.”</p><p>There is no word on why Natalya deleted that tweet. Without further context about why the finish went the way it did, it’s all just speculation. So far, Liv Morgan has not commented.</p><p>Pro wrestling fans are always looking for the next big controversy. As of now, it doesn’t seem like there is much to go on as to why any of this happened. Until we hear more from Liv Morgan or Natalya, the best people can do is guess.</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure><p><strong>What do you think of this story?
