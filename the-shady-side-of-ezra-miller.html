According to <a href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a>, the star doesn't reside in Los Angeles, either. For that matter, Miller <a href=#>doesn't even live in a glamorous city like New York or London</a>. They're so far removed from Tinseltown that the actor's living on a farm in an area of Vermont where they spent summer vacations as a child.</p><p>Part of the star's cynicism about Hollywood likely has to do with their own painful #MeToo experience, so you can't really blame them. Miller bravely shared the incident with THR, though they didn't call out the director and producer by name. "They gave me wine and I was underaged," Miller said. "They were like, 'Hey, want to be in our movie about gay revolution?' And I was like, 'No, you guys are monsters.' It's a great f**king age of being like, 'You know what? That s**t's unacceptable.' And it's amazing for a lot of us to watch. 'Cause, like, we all knew it was unacceptable when we f**king survived it." Miller added, "That's what Hollywood is. I thought we all knew we were sex workers."</p><p>If you or anyone you know has been a victim of sexual assault, help is available.
