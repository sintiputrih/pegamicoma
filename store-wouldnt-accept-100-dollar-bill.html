However, it’s quite common to see old bills circulate.</p><p>So, when one <a href=#>TikTok</a> user shared that a store in New Hampshire wouldn’t accept her old hundred-dollar bill, she was fuming. Not to mention, the reasoning they gave was pretty wild. Here’s the full scoop.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">A TikToker says a store wouldn’t accept her $100 bill — because the cashier and the manager, who were both young, didn't recognize the old bill.</h2><p>Baby… we have to do better! On June 24, 2023, TikTok creator <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kasey Lee (@kaseybay326)</a> shared her experience in a store where they wouldn’t accept her $100 bill.</p><p>“It's bad enough they can't tell time, address an envelope, or make change. At least they should know what all legal tender in the U.S. looks like. Imagine if I had tried to use a $2 bill or silver dollar for that matter,” the caption reads.</p><p>As the video starts, a frustrated Kasey sits in her car and tells her story.</p><p>“I just left a store here in New Hampshire and I have $142 worth of merchandise. I tried to check out and the 18-year-old — I know because she told me how old she was — behind the register refused to take my money,” Kasey says as she shows the $100 bill.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@kaseybay326 href=#>@kaseybay326</a><p>it's bad enough they can't tell time, address an envelope or make change ... at least they should know what all legal tender in the US looks like - Imagine if I had tried to use a $2 bill or silver dollar for that matter <a title=dobetteramerica href=#>#dobetteramerica</a> <a title=whatareweteachingthem href=#>#whatareweteachingthem</a> <a title=old100dollarbill href=#>#old100dollarbill</a> <a title=kaseybay href=#>#kaseybay</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Kasey Lee" href=#>♬ original sound - Kasey Lee</a></figure><p>“Because she said it wasn’t real,” Kasey said. “She saw the date, she saw 1990 and advised me that they didn’t make $100 bills back in 1990.”</p><p>Kasey shows the $100 bill once again and said, “I asked her to get her manager.”</p><p>Once the manager arrived, they were also aligned with the cashier.</p><p>“Her manager came over and is 26 years old. They also told me that my money was counterfeit,” Kasey says as she shows the currency again.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@kaseybay326 href=#>@kaseybay326</a><p>Replying to @sommerxxrosee I'm glad you said something cause I almost forgot this fun fact that I learned today 😂 <a title=whoknew href=#>#whoknew</a> <a title=americancurrency href=#>#americancurrency</a> <a title=100dollarbill href=#>#100dollarbill</a> <a title=kaseybay href=#>#kaseybay</a> <a title=learnedsomethingnewtoday href=#>#learnedsomethingnewtoday</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Kasey Lee" href=#>♬ original sound - Kasey Lee</a></figure><p>“Are you kidding me right now? They made $100 bills before this,” Kasey says while showing off a new $100 bill with a colorful strip. “Come on, guys. We have to be smarter than this.</p><p>Kasey then places her finger on her head, sighed, and said, “We’re screwed.”</p><p>In a follow-up video, Kasey explained that the cashier didn’t have the counterfeit marker. She also shared a trick she learned to spot a fake $100 bill.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">TikTok users are amused at the cashier’s ignorance in rejecting the $100 bill.</h2><p>A wise person once said common sense ain’t so common. In Kasey’s comment section on TikTok, folks are not only surprised by her currency being rejected but they are also troubled that the store didn’t have any counterfeit tools to at least check that the bill was real or fake.</p><p>“They didn’t have the marker that will tell you it’s fake?! Like I’ve never not seen a cashier have one 😂,” one person commented.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@kaseybay326</a></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@kaseybay326</a></figure><p>“It's the fact that they're so sure that they're right,” another user chimed in.</p><p>Given that someone ultimately lost their life due to a store clerk believing that a bill was fake, when it wasn’t — RIP George Floyd — it’s troubling that the cashier didn’t at least attempt to check the validity of the bill.</p><p>Cashiers, please do better.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqMGwvsRmrqitnJm7tXnAnJqeqKRifnF8jJ2mpaSRp3qjtcul</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ryan-reynolds-tweet-about-ryan-gosling-mix-up.html><span>←</span><span>Ryan Reynolds reacts to being mistaken for Ryan Gosling</span></a>
