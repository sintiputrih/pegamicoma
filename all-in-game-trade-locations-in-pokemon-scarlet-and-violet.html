Snom is an Ice/Bug-type Pokémon which evolves into Frosmoth when levelled up with High Friendship at night.

However, since the Haunter doesn’t have an Everstone, it will evolve into Gengar as soon as you complete the trade.</p><p>As of now, only three in-game trades are present in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. If you are unable to pinpoint the NPCs, keep your eyes peeled for a yellow textbox appearing on top of the NPC when in the location. The yellow text box will have the name of the Pokémon they are looking for, indicating there is a trade possibility.</p><h3>About the author</h3><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/bedf1bf51803430d907fb1e4ee827323?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamepur.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2Fcropped-gamepur_favicon-1-192x192.png&r=g2x" height=96 width=96 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Kuldeep Thapa</h3><p class=author-url></p><p class=author-desc>Kuldeep is an electrical engineer and a freelance writer for Gamepur with over 5 years of experience under the belt.
