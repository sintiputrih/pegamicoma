Each charge carries a maximum sentence of up to six months in prison.</p><p>Jordan was taken into police custody on July 27 after Bell claimed that he punched her in the face during an argument at a Denny’s parking lot in Arizona. <a href=#>TMZ</a> reported at the time that a female eyewitness to the incident told authorities that Jordan allegedly got in her face and grabbed her cigarettes, including one in her mouth, which is why he was charged with a second count of disorderly conduct.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Matt-Jordan-mugshot.jpg><p>The Atlanta native reportedly left the scene of the altercation, but Bell called police later in the day and helped them track down her boyfriend.</p><p>Moore, 48, and Jordan broke up in 2016. His anger issues were documented on The Real Housewives of Atlanta, including the time he <a href=#>broke down the reality star’s door</a> and <a href=#>punched her driver in the face</a>. Jordan also infamously <a href=#>got into a physical fight</a> with <a href=#><strong>Cynthia Bailey</strong></a>’s ex-husband, <strong>Peter Thomas</strong>, in the middle of a 2017 radio interview.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Moore was <a href=#>granted a temporary restraining order</a> against Jordan in March 2017 after accusing him of calling her “up to 30 times a day between September and February, even after blocking his number.” He was ordered to stay at least 200 yards away from the Bravo personality and her home.</p><p>Moore went on to <a href=#>marry <strong>Marc Daly</strong></a> in June 2017, and they <a href=#>welcomed a daughter</a>, Brooklyn, in November 2018. The couple <a href=#>separated in September</a>, but the former Miss USA told Us earlier this month that they are now <a href=#>taking their relationship “one day at a time.”</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaknZ6urm65zqipnqtdmsVuucCtq2ain6exorqMnJ%2BaqpeasW7DyK2fZpmjqK62uNOipaBll56%2FrbLRopynnF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jamie-lynn-spears-speaks-out-after-framing-britney-spears-doc.html><span>←</span><span>Jamie Lynn Spears Speaks Out After Framing Britney Spears Doc</span></a>
