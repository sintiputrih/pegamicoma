But the flip side of this is that a disproportionately high level of bid activity with one particular seller can set alarm bells ringing.</li><li><strong>Unrealistic Price Spikes:</strong> Watch out for insanely high or low prices that are nowhere near the actual market value of the card. These spikes may show the signs of a faked auction via shill bidding.</li></ul><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>Combatting Shill Bidding</h2><p>To solve the problem of shill bidding and to protect the hobby of sports cards, we must take measures somehow before it blows up.</p><ul><li><strong>Better Enforcement and Monitoring:</strong> Stringent algorithms to nab any form of shill bidding happening on online platforms (such as eBay).</li><li><strong>Community Awareness:</strong> The more the community is educated about shill-bidding, the less impact it will have.</li><li><strong>Regulatory Intervention:</strong> This type of collusion between auction platforms and regulatory authorities would provide actionable insights for building strong policies to prevent and punish shill bidders.</li></ul><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>In the End</h2><p>Shill bidding is a serious threat to the pure and legitimate aspects of the sports card hobby.</p><p>Knowing the side effects and attempting to prevent, them can help further the true essence and value of card collecting in the community.</p><p>It's important that, as enthusiasts and collectors, we hold each other accountable to help keep a fair, vibrant, sports card market available to all.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0miqqaeiqcBur8Crm6xnmKTEbr%2FHoqOlZZKesaW1zaBkoqtdp8KqusinnmasmJp6tLzOq6usZZOWv6V5x6iZm7E%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./harry-keenan-cruz-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-200755-html.html><span>←</span><span>Harry Keenan Cruz Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
