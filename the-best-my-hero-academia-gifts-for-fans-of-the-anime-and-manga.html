For an extra touch, U.A.’s mottos, “Plus Ultra” and “Go Beyond” are also displayed in the scarf.

Both pieces are made of acrylic yarn material, and according to reviewers, it’s fairly soft to the touch. To make your life simpler, the items are designed to fit people of various sizes, so you don’t have to worry about measurements.
