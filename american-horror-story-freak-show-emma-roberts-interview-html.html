Will she betray her true love or her partner-in-crime? Will the freaks ever be able to accept her as one of their own — and trust the fact that she might actually be able to help them? This week’s episode had Maggie coming clean, but who knows whether she’ll stay that way. We spoke to actress Emma Roberts, who plays the not-so-magical crystal-ball reader about her very own magical tendencies and how, as an <i>AHS </i>superfan, the seasons are all tied together.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-76cf15b1facf3a6ec547cdbf9820680e-3-0-0@published data-word-count=67><b>Your character’s big moment last night seemed to be coming clean. She really decided to turn that corner.&nbsp;<br></b><span>I think one of my favorite parts about this episode is the flashback scene with Stanley and I and how we met. What I just love about </span><i>American Horror Story</i><span> is you are always learning new tidbits from flashbacks and fantasies. I loved dressing up as a boy, pickpocketing.<br></span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-76cf15b1facf3a6ec547cdbf9820680e-4-0-0@published data-word-count=82><b>Ryan Murphy always seems to love telling you a character is awful in some way and then changing it up by giving them an endearing history.<br></b><span>He is such a genius at making you love the villain. Every season of the show I find myself rooting for the bad guys. There are many more layers to why they are doing things and you don’t see that on a lot of television shows. Usually you are rooting for the good guy or the underdog.</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-76cf15b1facf3a6ec547cdbf9820680e-5-0-0@published data-word-count=66><b>While Coven’s Madison had real magic powers of persuasion, Freak Show’s Maggie only acts like she does.<br></b><span>I love anything with magic because I grew up watching </span><i>Sabrina the Teenage Witch </i><span>and </span><i>Hocus Pocus</i><span>; there was such a witch craze when I was younger, so I was really into </span><i>Coven</i><span> and Maggie’s crystal-ball reading. I actually have a crystal ball in a special part of the house. &nbsp;</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-76cf15b1facf3a6ec547cdbf9820680e-6-0-0@published data-word-count=81><span></span><b>Do you think she can feel empathy for the freaks? How can they even trust her?<br></b><span>Maggie is the one who can blend in. She’s a grifter, she’s good at fitting in. So the fact that she is the odd man out in Freak Show, I think, is new to her and I think that is hard. All the freaks, they “want” to fit in and yet when Maggie wants to be a part of them, they kind of don’t let her.</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-76cf15b1facf3a6ec547cdbf9820680e-7-0-0@published data-word-count=6><b>Right.<br></b><span>She is a freak to them.</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-76cf15b1facf3a6ec547cdbf9820680e-8-0-0@published data-word-count=67><b>We ended on quite a cliffhanger. Can you assume that now Jimmy’s hands are really gone? And how will he survive?<br></b><span>When I read that episode I was like, “Wait, he has no hands. We still have more episodes! What do you mean he has no hands?” I was on the edge of my seat waiting for the next script being like, </span><i>What is going to happen?</i><span></span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-76cf15b1facf3a6ec547cdbf9820680e-9-0-0@published data-word-count=43><b>I want to ask you about <a href=#>our theory about all of the <i>American Horror Story </i>seasons being connected</a>. <a href=#>Ryan Murphy confirmed it.</a> One of the theories we have involves Madison [her character from <i>Coven</i>], and I was curious what you thought.<br></b><span>Tell me.</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-76cf15b1facf3a6ec547cdbf9820680e-10-0-0@published data-word-count=36><b>So Madison’s last name was Montgomery in <i>Coven</i> and in <i>Murder House</i>.
