He also pursued&nbsp;Dominique Deveraux (Diahann Carroll), eventually getting her to agree to marry him. However, Blake's (John Forsythe) half-sister caught Boydston in a lie and called off the engagement, sending this character away from Denver and — yep! — off the show.&nbsp;</p><p>Howard made his mark on "Dynasty," but he was better known as Ken Reeves on CBS' "White Shadow," reports <a href=#>People</a>. Reeves was a tough high school's clever basketball coach whose previous NBA affiliation made him a big deal among the team's members. Still, Howard's range surpassed that of present-day bigwigs. In 1972, he walked in Thomas Jefferson's historical shoes in the film and stage versions of "1776." In 1995, he appeared in the futuristic, conspiracy theory-centric "The Net," as&nbsp;the U.S. Under Secretary of Defense who had been set up by cyber-terrorists.&nbsp;</p><p>Howard earned praise and&nbsp;<a href=#>an Emmy</a>&nbsp;in 2009 as Jessica Lange's husband in HBO's "Grey Gardens," and in 1970, he won a Tony as Best Featured Actor for "Child's Play." The celebrated actor, who served as the Screen Actors Guild president, also guest-starred on "30 Rock" as Cabletown's CEO and on "The West Wing" as Judge Peyton Cabot Harrison III. A year before his death, Howard appeared in "The Wedding Ringer" with Kevin Hart, and "Joy" starring Jennifer Lawrence.&nbsp;</p><p>Ken Howard died of pneumonia on March 23, 2016.
