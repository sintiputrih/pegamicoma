<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Revisiting the GOATs Greatest Failure, The Day Tom Brady Got Benched for theBackup QB Jimmy Garo</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Former New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady has enjoyed a successful NFL career under coach Bill Belichick but also faced some of his lowest moments in Boston. The 2014 NFL regular-season game against the Kansas City Chiefs is infamous for Brady’s poor performances. It was also seen as the end of the Patriots dynasty of Belichick and Brady. The game was an obituary in the eyes of media for their chances of winning the Super Bowl ever again.</p><p>It was a shock to the system of NFL fans. Considering the work that the franchise and their superstar QB had put in to get to this stage. The 14-41 <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>loss</a> at the Arrowhead Stadium in front of a then-Guinness World Record-setting crowd, was a total <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>collapse</a> in every department. While completed just 60.9 percent of his 23 passes for a meager 159 yards, Brady recorded 1 TD pass, 2 INTs, and a lost fumble.</p><p>The game also became the first infamous instance of Brady sitting on the bench for a rookie Jimmy Garoppolo to take over the reins. Jimmy G showed some promise towards the end of the game by throwing a touchdown pass to <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Rob Gronkowski</a> for the final touchdown of the game. In the post-game presser, Brady <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>states</a>, “It was just a bad performance by everybody. We need to make sure we never have this feeling again. We’ve got to figure out what we have to do better.”</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>A twist of fate between Tom Brady and Jimmy Garoppolo and their respective NFL careers</h2><p>Despite the harrowing loss, the Patriots and head coach Bill Belichick quickly drew <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>positives</a> from their darkest moment. The franchise dramatically went on to win the Super Bowl XLIX title against Russell Wilson and the Seattle Seahawks. It was redemption for Brady, who led the comeback from a 24-14 <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>deficit</a> entering the 4th quarter to win 28-24.</p><a href=# class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b transparent-card"><img id="img-tag-nfl-news-tom-brady-and-gisele-bundchen-mirrored-royal-couple-prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-with-this-adorable-selfie?utm_campaign=internal_links&utm_medium=dive_deeper&utm_source=website-embed-image" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/Tomy-Brady-And-Gisele-Bundchen-550x315.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b card-content">Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen Mirrored Royal Couple Prince Harry and Meghan Markle With This Adorable Picture</p></a><p>On the other hand, the promising rookie Garoppolo never was able to oust Brady in New England. Brady went on to win 3 more Super Bowl rings. The former <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Patriots’</a> backup QB ended up moving to the <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>San Francisco 49ers</a>. His tenure saw him continue his inconsistent and injury-ridden performances.</p><p>Jimmy G got his opportunity to prove himself against <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Brady</a> in the 2019 Super Bowl but the Niners ended up losing that match-up.</p><img id=img-tag-node--img-loader-0 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/usatsi_10227647.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>As another NFL season approaches, the former teammates Brady and Jimmy G find themselves <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>potentially</a> playing against each other. With a rumored trade to the <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Carolina Panthers</a> gaining momentum, the former Patriots’ QB might face each other in 2022. While the pair have since rarely met, Brady taking on Garoppolo would be exciting in the NFC South division.</p><p>Watch This Story: <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Multi-Billionaires Jerry Jones, Robert Kraft, David Tepper & Stan Kroenke Combined Can’t Beat the Net Worth of This Guy Who Just Entered the NFL</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pr%2FSnqWtoZGhubq%2Fz6ipratemLyue82fo2amlazAbr7Er6CsoaSeu6h506GcZp%2BflsFus9GemK2do6l6p63IpayrnV2ptaZ5w5qwZqyfonqjvsCdsGafn6l6o7HNnJ%2BenF2bvLN506GcZpqRmLi2vIyqmWaimaK6unnGmqmoqKCkubB7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./miss-universe-2012-bikini-bodies-top-16-20122012.html><span>←</span><span>Miss Universe 2012 Bikini Bodies: Top 16</span></a>
