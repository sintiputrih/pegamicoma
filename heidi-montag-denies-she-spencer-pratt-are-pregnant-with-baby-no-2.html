With Gunner, I got pregnant the first month, so I was a little bit sad. But I decided to have faith and hope and a nice glass of wine to take the pressure off. So cheers … and God willing, next month.”</p><p>Montag previously raved about Gunner in July 2019. “He’s starting to talk a lot more, which is really fun,” she told Us. “He loves TV, which is great for traveling and he’s running the sprints everywhere. [He’s] just a lot of fun.” She added that her son “loves [playing with] crystals” and interacting with the Hills revival’s camera crew.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“He loves an audience,” she noted. “He’s a great artist, actually. He loves painting, and he’s really great at the piano.”</p><p>Pratt, for his part, applauded his wife for her dedication to parenting in June 2019. “When we started filming [The Hills: New Beginnings], Heidi was a very, very intense-attachment parent,” he told Us. “I’m sure some would say extreme, but to me it was just being a super mom.”</p><p>He then recalled “some very intense” moments before Montag learned to be away from Gunner. “She <a href=#>had not left Gunner</a> even for five seconds for, like, almost a year to that point,” he said. “That was a major adjustment and process for her. To be honest, if it [wasn’t] for The Hills, I don’t know if she would have ever left Gunner’s side. … [It] was incredible for … being healthy parents, having boundaries.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGahnZmZtm65zqermp9dmbKvtcSsZKyglWLAsbHNnJyrZaCnrrXAjJqpnmWgp7KousCnq2avmam1bq7Am7Bmpp9if3A%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./justin-biebers-controvertial-father-jeremy-relationship-with-daughter-in-law-hailey.html><span>←</span><span>Does Justin Bieber's Father Have Anything To Do With Hailey?
