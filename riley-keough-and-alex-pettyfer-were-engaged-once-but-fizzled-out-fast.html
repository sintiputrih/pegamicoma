The "Zola" star had mentioned a "boyfriend" several times on Twitter, but had not referred to Pettyfer by name. The, in March 2012, Keough was seen sporting an engagement ring while out with her beau. The engagement was confirmed by sources, but there was some doubt that the two "Magic Mike" co-stars would ever reach the altar.</p><p dir=ltr>When the engagement news broke one source spoke about why the "Back Roads" star was so drawn to his fiancée. "She's just sweet like a little girl or kitten ... kind of untouched by the world," the insider told <a href=#>E! News</a>&nbsp;in March 2012. They also doubted that Pettyfer and Keough would ever actually marry. "Considering Alex has had tattoos for Julia Roberts' niece [Emma Roberts] and Dianna Agron ... maybe an engagement ring isn't too much of a commitment?" the source added.</p><p dir=ltr>There was no declaration that the wedding had been called off but Pettyfer and "The Girlfriend Experience" actor parted ways after being together for more than two years. As Pettyfer told Andy Radio in 2018, a contributing factor to their split was his inability to visit Keough while she worked on "Mad Max: Fury Road" due to his severe fear of flying, although rumors circulated that the real reason the couple broke up was because Pettyfer was unfaithful. Following the break up, however, they rekindled their romance for a brief period before calling it quits for good.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamphbIRxgY6roKWdqWK4prvUoJ9mmZ6ZeqK4xLFkqZ2kqcansdFmrp6qlWKyr7PAoJydZZ%2BjsKZ5wa6rZp6Zr8etscNmpq6sXZuutMCO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./luka-modric.html><span>←</span><span>Luka Modric Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</span></a>
