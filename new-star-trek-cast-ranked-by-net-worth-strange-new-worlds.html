The 10-episode first season will run between May and July, with a second season already confirmed and in production. Strange New Worlds is a breath of fresh air for many Star Trek fans, who have often come across as dissatisfied with modern iterations of the famous franchise. Star Trek: Discovery and Star Trek: Picard on CBS All Access have both come under fire with audiences who loved The Original Series.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Discovery has especially been criticized, with <a href=#>fans feeling that the show is 'too woke.'</a>Picard<a href=#>has not received as much hate</a>, although many Trekkies have said that they don't care much for it, either. In their eyes, both these shows have departed from the spirit of their predecessors. Strange New Worlds is seen as a return to those good old days and is in fact a prequel to TOS, as well as a spin-off from Discovery.</p><p>Anson Mount, Rebecca Romijn and Ethan Peck will be reprising roles that they have already played in the CBS All Access series. We rank these stars - and their new colleagues - based on their net worths.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Who From The Cast Of 'Star Trek: The Original Series' Is Still Alive In 2021?</a></span></p><h2 id=celia-rose-gooding---500-000><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Celia Rose Gooding - $500,000</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At 22 years old, Celia Rose Gooding is the youngest member of the main cast in Star Trek: New Worlds.
