On the most recent episode of Kelly Clarkson’s daytime talk show, she did some strange things that caught their attention.</p><p>She had to go away for a while because she wasn’t acting like herself. Kelly wasn’t there in person when the show started, but she was there when it did. Kelly went away after that. Because she had COVID-19, the singer had to give her show from home because she was sick.</p><p>Kelly and Cher took turns being the hosts. She did what she could to keep the people watching at home interested.

She did tell someone what was going on, though.</p><p style=color:#252525>“Blake Shelton was talking to me, and all of a sudden, everything he said just disappeared. I had to grab his arm, and I thought, “Something is wrong.” She thought back.</p><p style=color:#252525>She went to the hospital after the show to find out what had happened.</p><p style=color:#252525>“I had a huge cyst on my ovary that burst!” She told the newspaper “I was laughing and crying so hard in the ER that I didn’t know what was going on.”</p><p style=color:#252525>That’s a natural reaction since she just went through two very painful health scares right after each other.

She also voiced the main character in the kids’ movie “Ugly Dolls.” She’s about to be on another season of “The Voice,” and in less than two weeks, her new daytime talk show, “The Kelly Clarkson Show,” will premiere.</p><p style=color:#252525>She said, “I never thought I’d be this happy.” “If someone had told me when I was 19 that I’d have my own TV show, I’d have been shocked.
