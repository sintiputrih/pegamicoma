That phrase is said a lot, but in this case, it's entirely true. The basketball legend has been hailed as one of the greatest athletes of all time, and his achievements on the court are nothing short of remarkable.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Jordan's basketball skills are unquestionable, his off-court behavior has been a subject of much debate over the years. In particular, many have accused him of being a jerk due to his feuds with other players and public figures. Sure, many athletes partake in rivalries, but Jordan's rivalries were unmatched in vitrol and hatred.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>A Look At The Rivalry Between Tom Brady And Peyton Manning</a></span></p><p>Jordan's behavior didn't just end with his expected rivalries against enemy teams. Even his teammates and supporters have talked about his questionable behavior. Jordan himself confirmed a lot of the rumors <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in 2020 when The Last Dance premiered to pandemic-stricken audiences,</a> which showed how fiery he truly was.</p><h2 id=what-made-michael-jordan-so-great>What Made Michael Jordan So Great?</h2><p>Jordan's fieriness certainly had its negative drawbacks, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">but it just may have led to him being the basketball GOAT</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Michael Jordan is widely regarded as one of the greatest basketball players of all time. He has won numerous awards and accolades throughout his career, including six NBA championships, five MVP awards, and ten scoring titles. Jordan's impact on the game of basketball is undeniable, and his legacy continues to inspire young athletes around the world. <a href=#>Jordan's also made billions from being an athlete</a>, an accomplishment that few others have ever done.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Michael Jordan's Net Worth Is Massive, But The Way He Spends It Has Fans Smiling</a></span></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to ESPN, Jordan played high school basketball at Laney High School</a> where he quickly became a standout player. Despite not making the varsity team until his junior year, Jordan averaged over 25 points per game during his senior season and was named a McDonald's All-American.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/michael-jordan.jpg><p>In 1984, Jordan declared for the NBA draft and was selected third overall by the Chicago Bulls. He made an immediate impact during his rookie season, averaging 28.2 points per game and earning Rookie of the Year honors. Over the next few years, Jordan established himself as one of the best players in the league with his incredible scoring ability and highlight-reel dunks.</p><p>Despite putting up impressive individual numbers early in his career, Jordan struggled to lead Chicago deep into the playoffs. That all changed in 1991 when he led the Bulls to their first NBA championship with a victory over Magic Johnson's Los Angeles Lakers in five games. Jordan was named Finals MVP after averaging 31.2 points per game during the series.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Over the next few years, Chicago became a dynasty under Jordan's leadership as they won five more championships between 1992 and 1998. Jordan was the Finals MVP for each of those championships, and he also won five regular-season MVP awards during that span.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/juanita-vanoy-s-net-worth-skyrocketed-following-her-divorce-settlement-from-michael-jordan.jpg><p>After winning his sixth championship in 1998, Jordan retired from basketball to pursue a career in baseball. He played for the Birmingham Barons, a minor league affiliate of the Chicago White Sox, but ultimately returned to basketball in 1995.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jordan's multiple comebacks had inconsistent success, with another Finals win with the Bulls. He then came back again to play wit the Washington Wizards, but Jordan and the Wizards severely struggled during that short-lived era. <a href=#>Athletes such as Tom Brady have also retired and un-retired</a>, something they clearly get from the Chicago legend.</p><h2 id=was-michael-jordan-a-jerk-when-he-played-basketball>Was Michael Jordan A Jerk When He Played Basketball?</h2><p>Jordan's leadership style was first and foremost often seen as aggressive and confrontational, even back when he was still playing and in his prime. He demanded excellence from himself and his teammates, often pushing them to their limits in pursuit of victory. Some saw this as inspiring, while others found it intimidating.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Idris Elba Wanted To Play Michael Jordan But Got Snubbed By The NBA Legend</a></span></p><p>Jordan's leadership style was not without its flaws, however. His intense demeanor could sometimes come across as abrasive or even bullying. He famously clashed with former teammate Scottie Pippen over contract negotiations, which led to tension between the two players. They talked about it in The Last Dance, and according to Fox Sports, Pippen has ripped Jordan in interviews for his recent biography.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/michael-jordan-2.jpg><p>Additionally, Jordan's tendency to take over games and dominate the ball could make various role and bench players feel left out or undervalued.</p><p>However, despite these occasional clashes, it is clear that Jordan's competitive spirit ultimately helped push his teams to greatness. His unwavering dedication to winning inspired those around him to elevate their own games and strive for excellence. And while there may have been moments when his teammates found him difficult or even intimidating, there is no denying that they respected him deeply for his commitment and drive.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite these criticisms, it is clear that Jordan's leadership style was effective in achieving his goals. In all fairness, he led the Chicago Bulls to 6 NBA championships. His drive and determination inspired those around him to work harder and strive for excellence.</p><p>Jordan's competitive nature was legendary. He had an unquenchable thirst for victory and would stop at nothing to win. This drive led to some incredible performances on the court but also raised questions about his sportsmanship and treatment of opponents. The essay will delve into how his competitiveness affected both himself and those around him.</p><p>One aspect of Jordan's leadership that is often overlooked is his ability to lead by example. He was always one of the hardest workers on the team, putting in countless hours of practice and training outside of games. This dedication inspired his teammates to follow suit and put in extra effort themselves, regardless of whether they felt left out when it came time to play.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Michael-and-Marcus-Jordan.jpg><p>However, all of that has to do with Jordan's ability as a leader and teammate. While he may have gotten some hatred and jealousy from his teammates, that negative energy pales in comparison to how Jordan's biggest rivals felt about him.</p><p>One of the most well-known disputes involving Jordan is his feud with Isiah Thomas. The two players had a rivalry that spanned several years and was marked by intense competition on the court.</p><p>However, things took a turn for the worse when Jordan refused to play on the 1992 Olympic Dream Team if Thomas was included. Once again, this was a topic heavily discussed in The Last Dance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This decision was widely criticized at the time, and many saw it as evidence that Jordan was more concerned with personal grudges than representing his country.</p><p>Their feud continued off the court as well. In his autobiography, Jordan wrote about how he felt betrayed by Thomas after he allegedly spread rumors about him having an affair with a woman who worked for Nike. Jordan also accused Thomas of trying to sabotage his career by convincing other players not to sign endorsement deals with him.</p><p>Overall, Jordan might have been somewhat controversial with how competitive he was, but it produced results. Most of that stayed on the court, as Jordan appears to be a well-rounded, nice guy off the court. <a href=#>Even the news of Larsa Pippen dating his son Marcus</a> hasn't brought him down.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0ecyimqGZlaF6q7vRnZinZZyeuKZ5yKdkq52RoXqttcWeZKOdoqB6rrHAp2Y%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./deepcool-gamerstorm-add-to-cpu-liquid-cooler-lineups.html><span>←</span><span>Deepcool &amp;amp; Gamerstorm Add to CPU Liquid Cooler Lineups with Castle 240/280 RGB and Captain 240 Pro</span></a>
