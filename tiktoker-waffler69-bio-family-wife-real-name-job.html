But even though he’s gone, we’re sure his legacy will be kept alive by his brother and his fans.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>This TikToker Waffler69 Bio looks back at his life.</span></p><h3><b>TikToker Waffler69 Cause Of Death</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>TikToker Waffler69 presumably passed away from a heart attack. On Jan 12, 2023, his brother, Clayton LeJeune wrote on his FB, “Hey y’all. Around 10 pm my brother died. I assume it was from a heart attack and was very sudden. Just keep my family in your thoughts.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Clayton even took to his own TikTok to explain that Waffler69 had died shortly after being taken to the hospital. “This is still pretty new, I don’t know what’s gonna be happening in the near future. But I thought I should get on TikTok and let everybody know. Please keep his legacy alive.” he added.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, he urged fans to keep watching his content that’s out before saying, “Keep him alive. He loved making people happy.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Waffler69 indeed loved making people smile and happy through his TikTok videos. The last food stunt he posted before his death included him dunking a giant-sized Froot Loop into a bowl of milk. Naturally, fans shared tributes in the comments.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>“I always loved watching you. You spread so much happiness and much laughter to all,” a fan wrote.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>While another posted, “RIP Taylor, sending my deepest condolences to your friends and family. You were one of my favorite content creators to watch. You will be missed, Rest in power.”</span></p><p><b>Trivia:</b><span style=font-weight:400> You might have seen Waffler69’s brother Clayton in several of his TikTok videos. He’s the one with the long hair who tasted Surstromming and gagged alongside the star.</span></p><h3><b>TikToker Waffler69 Age At The Time Of His Death</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>TikToker Waffler69 was 33 years of age when he died in Jan 2023.</span></p><h3><b>What Is TikToker Waffler69 Real Name?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>TikToker Waffler69’s real name is “Taylor Brice LeJeune.”</span></p><h3><b>What Job Did TikToker Waffler69 Hold?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>TikToker Waffler69 might be a TikTok star but for a living, he used to do </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Uber</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. He officially joined </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Uber</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> back in May 2015.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Before that, he used to work as a delivery for </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Takeout Express</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> — receiving orders from Dispatch and making pickups and deliveries in a timely manner. Also, he’s been a Package Handler at </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>FedEx</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> for 1½ years. There, he operated heavy machinery to move shipping crates from 500 – 3000 pounds.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>So, in a way, Waffler69 worked as a driver in some form or another all his life. “I like being on the move at my job. I don’t mind staying in an office or store all day but I would rather be on the road getting the job done,” he said.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Someday, he wanted further his driving by getting a CDL “I haven’t gotten the chance to make that commitment yet. I have a clean driving record and have never gotten a speeding ticket in my 11 years of driving. When I am on the road I stay calm, level-headed, and drive with caution,” he explained.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As for his passion for food, it comes from his jobs as an Assistant Kitchen Manager at </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>2 Paul’s Radically Urban Barbeque</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> from April 2014 to October 2016, as Kitchen Manager at </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The Wild Salmon Bar & Grill</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> from January 2009 to October 2010, and as a Driver Team Leader at</span><i><span style=font-weight:400> Dominoes</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> from Feb 2007 to Jan 2009.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Thanks to his popularity, Waffler69 also sold his merch (tees, shirts, stickers, and posters) on Etsy. Also, he offered personalized videos on Cameo @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>Wafffler69</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>. And not to mention his Creole Rice and All-Purpose Seasoning that went for $19.99.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>When Waffler69 wasn’t working, he liked ballooning, playing arcade games, vegetable gardening, fishing, and stargazing.</span></p><h3><b>TikToker Waffler69 Family</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>TikToker Waffler69 came from a family of at least five.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Amongst them, we’ve already talked about his 8-year-younger brother Clayton LeJeune (who first revealed his death). Here’s his FB @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>clayton.lejeune</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>. After Waffler69’s death, it was also Clayton who organized a fundraiser for the TikToker’s funeral with a goal of $13,500. He revealed that the Gofundme was mainly to help compensate their mother who had to pay for my Waffler69’s cremation as well as the medical expenses. “Anything extra I’m gonna give to my mom and try to help the grieving process as much as possible,” he added.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Their mother, Kimberly Lejeune is a Crowley, Louisiana native.
